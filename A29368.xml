         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Now if you mind the fir≈øt Ver≈øe of the Parable, you will find it brought in with a <hi>for. For the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man,</hi> &amp;c. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter ≈øaith, <hi>For we have for≈øaken all to follow thee, and what ≈øhall we have. But Je≈øus ≈øaith, he that hath for≈øaken Father or Mother, Wife or Children, Hou≈øes or Lands for my ≈øake, ≈øhall receive a hundred fold, and inherit eternal life; and they that are la≈øt ≈øhall be fir≈øt, and the fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ≈øhall it be in <hi>≈øuffering,</hi> many that are fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt; and ≈øo it ≈øhall be in <hi>≈øervice,</hi> in <hi>employment</hi> and in <hi>labour.</hi> For after he had ≈øpoken this Parable of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, he concludes <hi>the la≈øt ≈øhall be fir≈øt, and the fir≈øt la≈øt;</hi> concluding for ≈øuffering and for ≈øervice: and he gives the Rea≈øon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57690:6"/>of it from our Election; <hi>for many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but few cho≈øen:</hi> and ≈øhews the grounds of it, that it is of free grace, <hi>the fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt, and the la≈øt fir≈øt.</hi> So that as to ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and as to ≈øuffering, all is of free grace. Now take the≈øe words as they are in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the former, and they will afford us this Doctrine:</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That there is much of the freene≈øs of the grace of God, laid out both in our ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and ≈øufferings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Free grace in the matter of our ≈øervices and labour, and free grace in the matter of our ≈øufferings. <hi>The fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt, and the la≈øt fir≈øt: for many ≈øhall be called, but few cho≈øen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the pro≈øecution of this Doctrine, I ≈øhall</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Labour to ≈øhew you, That it is a great mercy to be u≈øed for God, and by God, either in a way of ≈øervice or ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for his Name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That there are ≈øome that God doth e≈øpecially ≈øingle out to ≈øerve him, or to ≈øuffer for him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That it is the free grace of God, that one ≈øerves above another.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ≈øhall ≈øhew wherein this free
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57690:6"/>grace of God doth appear or ≈øhine forth in the matter of our employment and ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I ≈øhall ≈øhew, why God will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and di≈øpo≈øe of our ≈øervices and ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in the way of free grace, or free love.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, I ≈øay, it is a great mercy to be u≈øed for God or by God in the matter of ≈øervice or ≈øufferings, it is a great mercy to be employed in any work for God. For,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The more ≈øerviceable any man or woman is for God, the more they honour God; and the more they honour God, the more will God honour them: when I te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie of any excellency in God, then I honour God: when God te≈øtifies of any honour in me, then God honours me; as now when God calls me to any ≈øervice, then God te≈øtifies an excellency in me, then God honours me: when a Governour puts any honour upon a common Souldier, he calls him forth to ≈øpecial ≈øervice: ≈øo it is an honour for a man to be ≈øerviceable to God. This was the honour of <hi>Mo≈øes, Mo≈øes the ≈øervant of the Lord:</hi> and when the Holy Gho≈øt puts an honour upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> he ≈øayes, <hi>The P≈øalm of</hi> David <hi>the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord:</hi> Not the P≈øalm of <hi>David</hi> the King of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> no, the P≈øalm of <hi>David</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57690:7"/>the ≈øervant of the Lord. So in the New Te≈øtament this was <hi>Pauls</hi> honour, <hi>Paul the ≈øervant of the Lord.</hi> Now is it not a great honour to honour God, and to be owned by God? Thus it is with them that ≈øerve the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The more ≈øerviceable any man is for God in his Generation, the more apt God is to accept of his work, though there be failings in the work: ob≈øerve what great failings there was in <hi>Aaron,</hi> yet God accepted of the work.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The more ≈øerviceable any man is while≈øt he lives, the more comfortably he will dye, when he comes to dye: what is a mans comfort upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, but that according to his mea≈øure he hath ≈øerved God? ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Glorifie me Oh Father, for I have done the work that thou ha≈øt ≈øent me to do.</hi> And ≈øo it is a mans comfort to do the work that God gives him to do; yea, it will be his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort at the day of death.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The more ≈øerviceable any man is whil≈øt he lives, the more he ≈øhall ≈øpeak when he is dead: there are them that being dead yet ≈øpeak: why, what ≈øpeaks <hi>Abell,</hi> but Faith, good Works, good Examples? He offered a better Sacrifice than <hi>Cain,</hi> he was truly ≈øerviceable to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57690:7"/>God in his day, and now he ≈øpeaks when he is dead; Thus <hi>Abell</hi> did, and thus it is with a ≈øerviceable man. Look how it is with a wicked man that is ≈øerviceable to the Devil, and that writes wicked and wanton Books that ≈øpeak when he is dead; ≈øo is it with a man that is ≈øerviceable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. This honour is in the ≈øervice of God above all others; and to ≈øay no more, this is the thing that is de≈øired more in ≈øome re≈øpects, than the enjoyment of Heaven, <hi>I de≈øire</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>to be di≈ø≈øolved, and to be with Chri≈øt, which is be≈øt of all: yet neverthele≈øs for your ≈øakes, and the ≈øervice of the Churches I de≈øire to live.</hi> So that I ≈øay in one re≈øpect this is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øirable than Heaven; for no ≈øuch work is to be done in Heaven. And is it not a great matter, very great to be ≈øerviceable unto God, to be u≈øed and employed by God either in ≈øervice or ≈øuffering?</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it is a great mercy to ≈øerve for God, ≈øo is it not a great mercy to ≈øuffer for God: to be called out to ≈øuffer for the Name of Chri≈øt? For ≈øaith the former Chapter, <hi>We have for≈øaken Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, Wife and Children, Hou≈øes and Lands for the ≈øake of Chri≈øt; but ≈øaith Chri≈øt, he that for≈øakes ≈øo much for me, ≈øhall receive a hundred fold, and eternal life; yea,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57690:8"/>he that ≈øuffers for me, ≈øhall reign with me.</hi> You carry a burthen, but Chri≈øt carries the heavy end, and you have communion with Chri≈øt al≈øo thereby; and thereby al≈øo your heart ≈øhall be filled with comfort, yea, even the comfort of the Holy Gho≈øt: the Spirit of God dwells in every believer; and that man that ≈øuffers for God, the Spirit of God re≈øts upon him, as the Dove re≈øted upon the Earth: and ≈øo ≈øaith <hi>Peter, the Spirit of God and of glory re≈øteth in you.</hi> A man is never more glorified, than when he ≈øuffers for God: remember that: When our Saviour Chri≈øt was upon the Cro≈øs, he was then glorious before the eyes of Heaven, and never more glorious than then; for <hi>now is the Son of man glorified:</hi> ≈øo may you ≈øay when in ≈øufferings, Now am I glorified: Oh, the glory of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian! Nay, ≈øayes the Martyr when going to the Stake, <hi>Now I begin to be a Chri≈øtian.</hi> And thereby he is a≈ø≈øured of eternal life and ≈øalvation. <hi>Our pre≈øent light afflictions</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>works an eternal and exceeding weight of glory.</hi> And ≈øayes our Saviour, <hi>If ye be reviled and reproached for my ≈øake, happy are you.</hi> And if you look into <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.28. you will find, that ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are an evidence to us. Thus now you ≈øee, it is a mercy, yea, a great mercy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57690:8"/>to ≈øuffer for the Name of Chri≈øt. That is the fir≈øt thing.</p>
            <p>But then Secondly, There are ≈øome that God doth graciou≈øly ≈øingle out to ≈øervice, or to ≈øuffer for him; this honour all the Saints have not, but ≈øome God doth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou≈øly ≈øingle out not only to ≈øervice, but to ≈øuffer for him. Now there is a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ≈øervice, and there is a mercenary ≈øervice; there is a judicious ≈øervice, and a gracious ≈øervice; ≈øome that God doth ≈øingle out graciou≈øly: po≈ø≈øibly a man may be <hi>providentially</hi> u≈øed in the ≈øervice of God; thus <hi>Naaman</hi> had a ≈øervant in his hou≈øe, that was providentially made u≈øe of for his Conver≈øion. So I ≈øay, a man may be made u≈øe of providentially, and al≈øo mercinarily and judiciou≈øly: ≈øo the Devils have been; <hi>Whom ≈øhall I ≈øend to be a lying Spirit in the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Send me, and he went.</hi> This is a judicious ≈øervice: and thus the Devils do ≈øerve for wages; and them al≈øo that are the In≈øtruments of the Devil: Per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are judicious ≈øervers; they are them that make clean the di≈øhes: ≈øo that I ≈øay, there are them that may ≈øerve God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially, mercenarily and judiciou≈øly. Providentially, and ≈øo all the creatures ≈øerve him. Mercenarily, ≈øo they ≈øerved
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57690:9"/>him that ≈øaid, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not done many wondrous works, yet Chri≈øt ≈øayes he never knew them, depart from me.</hi> And then there is a Judicious Service, as when God gave licence and power to de≈øtroy the ten Tribes: but then, as there is a Providential ≈øervice, a Mercenary ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a Judicial ≈øervice; ≈øo there is al≈øo a <hi>Gracious ≈øervice;</hi> There are ≈øome that God doth graciou≈øly ≈øingle out to ≈øerve him, and to ≈øerve him in ≈øuffering for him. Did not God graciou≈øly ≈øingle out <hi>Caleb</hi> to ≈øerve him? For it is ≈øaid, <hi>he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed God fully:</hi> and did not God in the New Te≈øtament ≈øingle out <hi>Paul? Go thy way to</hi> Ananias, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>And he trembling and a≈øtoni≈øhed ≈øaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord ≈øaid, ari≈øe, go into the City, and it ≈øhall be told thee what thou ≈øhalt do.</hi> So I ≈øay, God doth graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly ≈øingle out ≈øome, not only to ≈øerve him, but to ≈øuffer for him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is it that makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that ≈øome are employed in the work and ≈øervice of God, when others are not? It is only the free grace of God. It may be, you may think it is from men, that the providential hand doth fall upon one more than upon another; or that it is the will of men to ≈øingle out whom they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57690:9"/>will for ≈øufferings; but it is only the free grace of God. Look what the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of God doth in a way of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affliction, that the free grace and love of God doth in a way of mercy. As now, ≈øuppo≈øe two men be together in a transgre≈ø≈øion, one is ≈øingled out to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the other is not: Why? The Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty orders it ≈øo: <hi>Think ye that they on whom the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>

                  </gap>f the Tower of</hi> Siloam <hi>fell, were greater ≈øinners than others:</hi> No: a man may be wrapt up in great afflictions and calamities as <hi>Job</hi> was: and why ≈øo? It is the Soveraignty of God, I will do what I will with my own: ≈øo look what Gods Soveraignty doth in a way of judgement, the ≈øame the free grace of God doth in a way of mercy. Oh! Is it not a great mercy to be ≈øingled out to ≈øuffer for the name of Chri≈øt, Phil. 1.29. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nto you it is given, not only to believe, but to ≈øuffer for Chri≈øt.</hi> So I ≈øay, it is not only to believe, but to ≈øuffer: and ≈øo God doth graciou≈øly choo≈øe ≈øome and not others for this great work.</p>
            <p>But Fourthly, Wherein doth the free grace of God ≈øhine forth and appear in the matter of our ≈øervices and ≈øufferings?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, In many things: Will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with your own employments? What is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57690:10"/>rea≈øon one man is called forth to an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and not another? It is only the free grace of God. What is the rea≈øon one man hath ≈øucce≈øs in a work, and not another? It is only the free grace of God. But to clear it the more unto you; the more unlikely any per≈øon is to ≈øerve or ≈øuffer for God, the more the free grace of God ≈øhines forth in that per≈øon. Now who are tho≈øe that God doth generally make u≈øe of in his ≈øervice, but tho≈øe that are the mo≈øt unlikelie≈øt per≈øons? As now will you in≈øtance in matter of mens places, E≈øtates, Callings; there was two ≈øervants concerned in the conver≈øion of <hi>Naaman,</hi> the ≈øervant of the Prophet, and <hi>Naamans</hi> own ≈øervant: Who is mo≈øt likely now? certainly the ≈øervant of the Prophet; yet you ≈øee the other doth it: ≈øo that I ≈øay, the unlikelie≈øt oftentimes God makes u≈øe of; which is to ≈øhew forth the freene≈øs of his grace: Will you in≈øtance in the matter of ability as to the Mini≈øtry, who more unfit and unlikely to be u≈øed in the Go≈øpel, than a company of Fi≈øhermen, poor Fi≈øhermen? for it is ≈øaid, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they were unlearned, and yet you find them made u≈øe of by our Saviour for the promulgation of the Go≈øpel. Will you in≈øtance in the matter of free grace?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57690:10"/>Who was ≈øo commended as <hi>Nathaniel</hi> that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> to Chri≈øt? <hi>Behold an I≈øraelite indeed, In whom there is no guile.</hi> Who more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be u≈øed in Gods ≈øervice than <hi>Paul</hi>? Was it likely <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øhould bring any honour to God, who was whipt and ≈øcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up and down Town like a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor? yet this man preached: and do you think he was like to do any good by his preaching? yet you find it is ≈øaid, <hi>he did more than they all;</hi> and God ble≈ø≈øed his Mini≈øtry, and he converted the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Why is this but to ≈øhew that God will make u≈øe of them that are mo≈øt unlikely to do him ≈øervice: <hi>For they that are fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt;</hi> and this only to ≈øhew the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his grace.</p>
            <p>But wherein doth the grace of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as to our ≈øufferings? for the great thing is to ≈øtand our ground: To this I an≈øwer;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Is it not a great mercy, that the great God of Heaven and Earth ≈øhould call us worms to bear witne≈øs to his Name, his great Name, yea, to ≈øuffer for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is it not a great mercy and favour, that God will take notice of all the injuries that are done unto them that ≈øuffer for him, as done unto him≈øelf? <hi>I know thy works</hi> (≈øaith God) do men jeer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57690:11"/>thee and reproach thee for the ≈øake of Chri≈øt? then happy art thou. What wrong is done unto them that ≈øuffer for God, he takes it as done unto him≈øelf: So that I ≈øay, it is a great mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that the God of Heaven ≈øhould take tho≈øe injuries as done unto him≈øelf, that are done unto us. Nay, (≈øaith God) <hi>I will give you a mouth, and tell you what you ≈øhall ≈øpeak when you come before men. Take no thought for what you ≈øhall ≈øpeak, for it ≈øhall be given you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is it not a great mercy, that your hearts ≈øhall be filled with joy in the mid≈øt of ≈øufferings? <hi>They went away rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were counted worthy to ≈øuffer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is it not a great mercy, that ≈øome ≈øhall ≈øtand, that are likelie≈øt to fall, when others fall, that were likely to ≈øtand?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Is it not a great mercy, that tho≈øe whom the adver≈øaries think ≈øhall di≈øhonour and marr the work of God, that they ≈øhould bring more honour to God, and ≈øuffer more powerfully and ≈øtrongly for him than others, and that they ≈øhould be u≈øed mo≈øt for God?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Is it not a great mercy, that when God ≈øeems to have mo≈øt di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt us, his Love ≈øhould be then mo≈øt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57690:11"/>≈øet upon us, as it is in ≈øufferings? Who would but think, that when we are given into the hands of wicked men, it is from the di≈øplea≈øure of God again≈øt us, when yet it is from the free grace and great love of God unto us?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Is it not a great mercy, to con≈øider, that what is our greate≈øt mi≈øery <hi>≈øeemingly,</hi> that that ≈øhould contribute to our greate≈øt mercy? Thus it is in our ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for the Name of God: You ≈øee what great and wondrous things were done by the death of Chri≈øt; and ≈øo al≈øo what wonders were done by <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> when he was ≈øold thither by the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs of his Brethren; It is the way of God unto his people, that the more others work to do them <hi>harm,</hi> the more God doth order it to prove for their <hi>good;</hi> which is only from the free grace, love and favour of God. We never did any work yet, but free grace paid us for it: even the work of ≈øuffering, God payes us for that: He was a Preacher to day, yet carried to Pri≈øon, that paid him for it. Yea, Chri≈øtians are paid for the work they never did: and what is the Rea≈øon of it, but only the free grace of God. Thus you ≈øee wherein the free grace of God appeares and ≈øhines forth.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57690:12"/>
            <p>Fifthly, Why will God carry on the work of our ≈øervices and ≈øufferings in the way of free grace? Why, God will order our employments and ≈øufferings in a way of free grace, that we may not be proud of them: We are apt to be proud of our employments and ≈øufferings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will carry on his work ≈øo, as that he may keep us from the ≈øin of pride and haughtine≈øs, when we ≈øhall con≈øider it is the free grace of God to ≈øingle us out to ≈øervice or ≈øufferings. Why ≈øhould we be proud? God loves to confound the wicked and ungodly in the world, by making tho≈øe that are the mo≈øt unlikely, to be ≈øerviceable to him≈øelf; and by orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ≈øervices and ≈øufferings in a way of free grace. This God doth to confound the Wi≈ødom and Rea≈øon of worldly men. <hi>Many are called, but few cho≈øen.</hi> God hath ≈øet the weak to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the ≈øtrong. Again, God doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpo≈øe of his work in a way of free grace, that none may be di≈øcouraged from his ≈øervice, or ≈øuffering for him. If none but great, and mighty, and holy men were to be u≈øed in Gods ≈øervice, then the weak would be di≈øcouraged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpi≈øed, and we ≈øhould be ready to ≈øay, I am not worthy. Now God doth ≈øo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57690:12"/>and di≈øpo≈øe of his work, as not to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the weak, but to give encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all. Well then if ≈øo, A word for Application. Is this a Truth that we have heard, that all that God doth either as to the ordering of our ≈øervices or ≈øufferings is in a way of free grace? What have we then to ≈øay, but as Job, <hi>The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away; ble≈ø≈øed be the Name of the Lord?</hi> You ≈øay, that God choo≈øes whom he plea≈øes to ≈øerve him, or to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for him; and that it is out of free grace: if ≈øo, why ≈øhould not <hi>all</hi> ≈øuffer? But you hear it is not all, but ≈øome, that God doth graciou≈øly ≈øingle out to ≈øuffer for him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>But here ≈øome may ≈øay, <hi>I am weak, and do not any work for God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But give me leave: Is Family work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? The Apo≈øtle in≈øi≈øts much upon that in his Epi≈øtles, he calls much upon Parents, Children, Ma≈øters, and all to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Reformation work is a great work, or el≈øe the Apo≈øtle would never have ≈øpoken ≈øo much of it, and exhorted ≈øo much to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is it nothing to do the work of your generation? to do the work that is ≈øuitable unto your condition? All men are not called to all works: there is a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57690:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>peculiar work to every man. Now is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting work nothing? Is ≈øupporting work nothing? Is relieving work nothing? This comforting work it is Angelical work. Is it nothing to improve the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that God hath given thee? This will be the great Que≈øtion at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Faithful, or not faithful? There are none but have Talents more or le≈øs, which they mu≈øt then an≈øwer for.</p>
            <p>But you may be ready to ≈øay, <hi>I have no work.</hi> That is a mi≈øtake; for there are none but have work: therefore look unto that which is your work.</p>
            <p>But you may ≈øay again, <hi>Though I have work and ≈øervice, yet my ≈øervice may be a judicious ≈øervice, or a mercinary ≈øervice, or a providential ≈øervice: Now how ≈øhall I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh my ≈øervice, Whether it be a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, a judicious, a mercenary ≈øervice, or whether God hath graciou≈øly ≈øingled me out to ≈øerve him in a way of free grace and love?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an≈øwer to this, take the≈øe two or three things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If it be a work or ≈øervice given you by free grace, then God will lead you more and more, and bring you to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the de≈øign of his work. When <hi>Peter</hi> was called to open the door of the Temple, at fir≈øt he did not know
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57690:13"/>the de≈øign, but afterwards he was told it. So thus it is with thee: If God do call thee to work, he will acquaint thee with the de≈øign of the work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you ≈øerve God in a way of free grace, then you will be contented with your work: yea, you will be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be u≈øed for God, to be laid out for God, you will ≈øay, I am contented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe God hath called me.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When God doth make u≈øe of a man in a way of free grace, then that man doth not make any great bargains for him≈øelf: they that ≈øerve God any other way, will make great bargains for them≈øelves, make u≈øe of his ≈øervice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe their e≈øtates: But now they that ≈øerve God out in a way of free grace, will not do ≈øo. Therefore now you that are at work, do you pocket up at work? Do you make great bargains for your ≈øelves? If ≈øo, this is no free grace work.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, <hi>I am afraid I do not ≈øerve God in a way of free grace, becau≈øe I have no ≈øucce≈øs in my work. But you may ob≈øerve in the Scripture, that ≈øometimes a man may be called to work by free grace, and may have ≈øucce≈øs at the beginning, as</hi> Jo≈øeph <hi>had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, and yet the ≈øucce≈øs may leave him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:57690:14"/>
            <p>As now there are them that preach many years, and never convert one ≈øoul, yet this ≈øhould not di≈øcourage them; for free grace may call you to a work, and yet you may not find that ≈øucce≈øs in it which you expected.</p>
            <p>But then again, here is the great Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on yet behind; <hi>Suppo≈øe God doth deal with the children of men in a way of free grace and love, then what is my duty, and what ≈øhall I do, that I may ≈øo ≈øerve and ≈øuffer, as to ≈øerve and ≈øuffer under the conduct of free grace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an≈øwer to this, you may take it in the≈øe following particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt then, if you would ≈øerve and ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under the conduct of free grace, then ≈øerve your call fully; and go to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt of the thing called unto, leaving God to do his work: Do your work to the utmo≈øt, and leave God to do his. When God called <hi>Jo≈øhuah</hi> to do a work fully, and he did it, God ≈øhewed mercy to him, and to his po≈øterity after him: And ≈øo when <hi>John</hi> was called to a work, and he did it by halves, God blew upon him, and upon his po≈øterity after him. Therefore I ≈øay, when God calls us to a work, let us do our work fully, and leave God to do his work.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57690:14"/>
            <p>Secondly, If you would ≈øerve God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of free grace, then when you find any warmth or heat upon your affections, take the hint of this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the doing of that work God calls you to.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would ≈øerve God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of free grace, then do not envy others that are more employed, that have better ≈øucce≈øs, and are better paid than your ≈øelves: ob≈øerve how it is with two Servants in a great Shop, the one at one end, the other at the other end; the one may take more money than the other, yet they do not envy one another: and why? but becau≈øe they both ≈øerve one Ma≈øter. Thus it ≈øhould be with the Saints and ≈øervants of God, they all ≈øerve one Ma≈øter; and therefore one ≈øhould not envy another, becau≈øe he is more employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or hath better ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you would ≈øerve God under the conduct of free grace, then be ≈øure you do not ≈øerve for wages: be not mercina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in your ≈øervice. It becomes tho≈øe that ≈øerve under free love to be very free in their ≈øervice: ≈øaith one, I have been wrought upon by my Neighbour, and ever ≈øince I have endeavoured to do him good. Now it is God that hath wrought upon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57690:15"/>us by his free grace; and if ≈øo, let us free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øerve him, and labour to do him all the honour we can. When the Prodigal fir≈øt thought of returning home unto his Fathers hou≈øe, he ≈øaith fir≈øt, <hi>Let my Father make me as one of his hired ≈øervants.</hi> This was a Legal expre≈ø≈øion; I will be hired, <hi>Let him make me as one of his hired ≈øervants;</hi> but when he ≈øaw his Fathers love, he talked no more of his hired ≈øervice. Inheritance is not of the Bond-woman, but of the free. I do confe≈øs indeed, it is not unlawful to look unto the recompence of reward: yea, it is lawful for us to do it. But now do you de≈øire to ≈øerve under the conduct of free grace, then look not for wages; do not do as an hireling, as the labourers of the Vineyard: no, do it freely in a way of love, thankfulne≈øs and believing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would ≈øerve under the conduct of divine love, then ≈øerve God with fear upon the account of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. <hi>Work out your ≈øalvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good plea≈øure.</hi> If you do ≈øerve and work, then fear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of Gods goodne≈øs to you.</p>
            <p>And to conclude this Application: If you would ≈øerve as tho≈øe that ≈øerve under
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57690:15"/>the conduct of free grace and love; then have a care that in all your workings you depend upon nothing but the free grace of God in reference to your call: and if ≈øo, why then ≈øhould you not willingly ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the Name of Chri≈øt? would you know whether you are <hi>called</hi> to ≈øuffer? why, this is a certain Rule, when the ca≈øe is ≈øo with you, that you mu≈øt either ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or ≈øin.</p>
            <p>But then a ≈øecond word of Application may be this. Is it ≈øo, that ≈øo much of the free grace is laid out in reference to our ≈øervices and ≈øufferings? Then Fir≈øt, Let us freely and willingly ≈øuffer for the Name and Cau≈øe of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is it ≈øo, that ≈øo much of the free grace of God is laid out in reference to our ≈øervices and ≈øufferings? then why ≈øhould we not be contented with our ≈øufferings; not only contented in ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or contented upon ≈øuffering, but contented with ≈øufferings: Our Saviour tells us, that <hi>they that will be his Di≈øciples mu≈øt deny them≈øelves, take up the Cro≈øs and follow him:</hi> Not only take up the Cro≈øs, but follow him; yea, and deny them≈øelves. Some will deny them≈øelves in this or that, but will not take up the Cro≈øs: but ≈øaith our Saviour, <hi>If any man will follow me, let
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57690:16"/>him take up the Cro≈øs and follow me.</hi> Thus now, if Chri≈øt calls us to ≈øuffer, let us ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer freely, becau≈øe his grace is free.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would ≈øerve under the conduct of free grace, then take heed of any Legal <hi>therefore</hi> upon your ≈øufferings, Matth. 9.27. <hi>Then an≈øwered</hi> Peter, <hi>and ≈øaid unto him, behold, we have for≈øaken all and followed thee, what ≈øhall we have therefore?</hi> This was a Legal <hi>therefore;</hi> Chri≈øt an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ≈øaid, <hi>You ≈øhall have your reward, but many that are fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt, and the la≈øt fir≈øt.</hi> The only way to take away this Legal <hi>therefore,</hi> is to look more and more upon the free grace of God either in your ≈øervices or ≈øufferings for him; for thus all mu≈øt do, that either ≈øerve God or ≈øuffer for him, under the conduct of free grace: Do you de≈øire to ≈øerve God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to employments or ≈øufferings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of free grace and love? then look more and more upon his free grace, and depend upon it in reference to your call, in reference to your a≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, in reference to your dependance, and in reference to your reward, ≈øeeing all is of free grace, ble≈øs the name of the Lord. Thus it is both in ≈øuffering work, and in ≈øervice, <hi>the fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt, and the la≈øt fir≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:57690:16"/>
            <p>Therefore as you would de≈øire to ≈øerve or ≈øuffer under the conduct of free grace, rejoyce and ble≈øs God for his free grace; remember this, that whether we ≈øerve or ≈øuffer, it is of free grace.</p>
            <p>Thus you ≈øee how the free grace of God ≈øhines forth both in our ≈øervices and ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <hi>Is it not Lawful for me to do what I will with my own, is thine eye evil becau≈øe I am good, ≈øo the la≈øt ≈øhall be fir≈øt and the fir≈øt la≈øt, becau≈øe many are called but few cho≈øen.</hi>

                     <hi>2 THES. 2.16, 17.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Now our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf, and God even our Father which hath loved us, and given us Everla≈øting Con≈øolation and good hope through Grace; Comfort your hearts and e≈øtabli≈øh you in every good word and work.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HAving already treated of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the grace of God in reference to our Imployments and ≈øufferings; I do intend to ≈øhew you al≈øo the freene≈øs of the grace of God, in reference to our Comforts and Con≈øolations; and this Text you ≈øee ≈øaith, <hi>God hath given us Everla≈øting Con≈øolation,</hi> and tells us ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>God hath given us this everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Con≈øolation through grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore without any further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, you ≈øee that free Love is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57690:17"/>upon all our ≈øpiritual Comforts. For what is more free than gift? <hi>Now our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf, and God even our Father hath given us everla≈øting Con≈øolation and hope through grace;</hi> Therefore it is by the grace, by the free grace of God, that we are truly comforted:</p>
            <p>There is much of the freene≈øs of Gods grace and love laid out in our ≈øpiritual comforts and con≈øolations.</p>
            <p>For the opening of this Argument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ≈øhall ≈øhew you that it is a great mercy to be truly Comforted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is po≈ø≈øible for Gods own people, to live a great while without any con≈øiderable Comfort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is not in the power of any Creature, or any thing on this ≈øide God or Chri≈øt, to comfort a poor di≈øtre≈ø≈øed drooping ≈øoul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That when God doth give or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtow comfort upon any, he gives and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowes it in a way of free grace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To ≈øhew wherein the grace and love of God is manife≈øted, in the matter of our ≈øpiritual Comforts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Why God will deal with us in the way of free grace and love, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our comforts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When a man may be truly ≈øaid to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57690:18"/>be comforted in a way of free grace and love.</p>
            <p n="8">8. What a poor drooping ≈øoul mu≈øt do, that he may be truly comforted in a way of free love; and in ca≈øe he be ≈øo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, what returns he ≈øhould make. Of the≈øe in order.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, I ≈øay it is a great mercy to be truly comforted: For it is a promi≈øed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and promi≈øed mercies are no ≈ømall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; now this is a mercy promi≈øed, Mat. 5.4. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that mourn, for they ≈øhall be comforted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, As this is a mercy promi≈øed, ≈øo it is the proper birth, fruit, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the holy Gho≈øt, Gal. 5.22. <hi>But the fruit of the ≈øpirit is love, joy, peace, long ≈øuffering, gentlene≈øs, goodne≈øs, faith.</hi> Joy and peace are the proper fruits of the holy Gho≈øt, and therefore no ≈ømall mercies.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As this comfort is the proper birth, fruit, and effect of the holy Gho≈øt; ≈øo it is the main part of the Kingdom of God, Rom. 14.17. <hi>For the Kingdom of God is not meat nor drink, but righteou≈øne≈øs peace and joy in the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> It is a main part of the Kingdom of God, and if ≈øo, no ≈ømall matter.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This comfort is reward al≈øo,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57690:18"/>as well as a main part of the Kingdom of God. Comfort and Joy in the holy Gho≈øt is both duty and reward; ≈øo it is promi≈øed in the forementioned Scripture, Matt. 5. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that mourn, for they ≈øhall be comforted;</hi> and if ≈øo then ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is no ≈ømall thing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, As it is duty and reward, ≈øo it is that grace whereby you are inabled to read your other graces. When a man is under great Temptations, Sorrows, and Afflictions, it is a hard thing to read his graces; but now this helps us to read our Graces: ≈øome will ≈øay they cannot read their graces, they lie at the bottom; As to explain it, take this plain compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon, There are many Fi≈øhes in a Fi≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond, but now in rainy and foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fi≈øh lye all at the bottom, and are not to be ≈øeen; but in fair weather the fi≈øh ≈øwim and are vi≈øible: So if it be foul weather upon a ≈øoul, if it be dark and gloomy weather, the ≈øoul cannot read his graces; but now when God ≈øhines upon him, then he is inabled to read them, yea though his graces lye at the bottom as I may ≈øay, yet the poor ≈øoul is abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>o read them, and if it be ≈øo, it is no ≈ømall thing, 'tis no ≈ømall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to read our graces, our other graces.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:57690:19"/>
            <p>Sixthly, As it is that grace whereby you are inabled to read your other graces, ≈øo it is that whereby you joy in all good things. Grief and ≈øorrow ≈øtreighten the ≈øoul, ≈øtreighten the heart, but joy and comfort dilate the ≈øoul, widen and open the heart. P≈øalm 119.32. <hi>I will run the way of thy Commandments, when thou ≈øhalt enlarge my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, As by this grace you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to joy in all good things, ≈øo it is al≈øo that grace, whereby you are inabled to bear up again≈øt every evil thing; to bear up under all afflictions: Are you reproached? by this comfort you are inabled to bear up again≈øt reproaches; for ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter, If you be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for the name of Chri≈øt, happy are you:</hi> Are you reproached? Comfort will turn that to your benefit and ble≈ø≈øing: Are you per≈øecuted? <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are you when men ≈øhall revile and per≈øecute you, rejoyce,</hi> &amp;c. Are you not only per≈øecuted but beaten too? Comfort will bear up your hearts under all ≈øtripes, and afflictions; for we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ≈øung in the Stocks: well but this is not all.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, This is that grace that will ≈øtrengthen and e≈øtabli≈øh you in the good waies of God. Mark how they go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57690:19"/>in 2 The≈ø≈ø. 2.16, 17. <hi>Now our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf, and God even our Father which hath loved us, and hath given us everla≈øting con≈øolation, and good hope through grace, comfort your hearts, and ≈øtabli≈øh you in every good word and work.</hi> Comfort and e≈øtabli≈øhment go together, and if it be ≈øo, it is no ≈ømall matter.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, This is that grace that will give a beauty and lu≈øtre to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion. The comforted Chri≈øtian is the truly beautiful Chri≈øtian. If a man have never ≈øo much beauty in his face, yet if his face be wrinkled with grief, and blubbered with tears, the beauty of his face is not ≈øeen; but when joy and comfort comes, that wipes off all, and his beauty then is ≈øeen. So here, comfort doth not only take away reproach from your profe≈ø≈øion, but it gives a lu≈øtre, a beauty to your profe≈ø≈øion; the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chri≈øtian I ≈øay is the truly beautiful Chri≈øtian; and if ≈øo, ≈øurely it is a great mercy to be truly comforted.</p>
            <p>That is the fir≈øt thing in general, that it is a great mercy to be truly comforted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it is a great mercy to be truly comforted, ≈øo it is po≈ø≈øible for Gods own ≈øervants and deare≈øt children, to live a long time without any con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57690:20"/>comfort, any fundamental comfort, their hearts may faint; <hi>My heart and my ≈øoul fainteth</hi> ≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt: and you know how it was with <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 10.17. You may ≈øee how he was bowed down, he complains <hi>there was no ≈øtrength remained in him, till there came one and touched him, and ≈øet him upon his legs again:</hi> a good man may faint and want comfort, and all the former comforts that he hath had may be Eclip≈øed. <hi>Re≈øtore to me the joy of thy ≈øalvation,</hi> P≈øalm 51.12. ≈øaith <hi>David;</hi> his glory and comfort was eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed: yea po≈ø≈øibly a gracious ≈øoul may live a long time without comfort; <hi>How long wilt thou forget, yea forget me O Lord, what for ever?</hi> P≈øalm 13.1. I ≈øay a man may live a long time without any con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable comfort. There is a time when God will try his people; and ≈øee whether they will take comfort from his hand, or from another hand; it may be it may be ≈øo with you ≈øometimes: God may try, whether you will wait upon him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and re≈øt upon him for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As a man may live long without comfort, ≈øo it is not in the power of any thing, on this ≈øide God and Chri≈øt, to give comfort to a poor drooping ≈øoul:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57690:20"/>this is the Lords prerogative. <hi>I am the Lord that comforteth.</hi> This is his name. <hi>Father of mercies, and God of all comfort and con≈øolation;</hi> and 2 Cor. 7.6. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs God that Comforteth tho≈øe that are ca≈øt down comforted us,</hi> &amp;c. It is Gods prerogative only, to do it, comforting work is creation work; it is not in the power of the creature, but of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. I≈øa. 57.19. <hi>I create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near ≈øaith the Lord, and I will heal him.</hi> It is Gods work to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and not in the power of any other; Man may be in≈øtrumental to comfort, but it is none but God alone that can do the work.</p>
            <p>But ≈øome may object and ≈øay, can none but God alone comfort?</p>
            <p>No none but God alone can rate off Satan. If a great dog, or ma≈øtiff be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a child or a ≈øheep, a ≈øtranger comes and ≈øtrikes him, and calls him off, but the dog takes no notice of him; but when the Ma≈øter comes, he rates him off pre≈øently; none but the Ma≈øter can do it. So here it is none but God that can rate off Satan from worrying the poor droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øoul, when it is under temptation, none but God the Ma≈øter: It is not in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57690:21"/>the power of any creature, but in the power of God alone; it is in the power of none but the third per≈øon in the Trinity, the ≈øpirit of God: what needed the third per≈øon in the Trinity to have come into the world as he is now, if any other could comfort. As none can redeem but Chri≈øt the ≈øecond per≈øon of the Trinity; becau≈øe the ≈øecond per≈øon came from Heaven on purpo≈øe to redeem. So none can comfort but God, and his ≈øpirit; becau≈øe the third per≈øon came from Heaven to do it, there is none but God alone that can comfort a poor ≈øoul.</p>
            <p>That is the third particular.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When God doth be≈øtow comfort, he be≈øtows it, and gives it in a way of free grace, in a way of free love, and grace. See but how they go together in the Text, <hi>Who hath given us everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing con≈øolation through grace.</hi> I will give you one Scripture more to prove it, and con≈øider it well, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. you have there the draught of a mans Conver≈øion. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> he goes on in his ≈øin; and all on a ≈øudden God gives in a word to him at 14, 15, ver≈øes. <hi>For God ≈øpeaketh once, yea twice, but man perceiveth it not: In a dream, in a vi≈øion of the night, when deep ≈øleep falleth upon men, in ≈ølumberings upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57690:21"/>the bed, Then He openeth the ears of men, and ≈øealeth their in≈øtruction,</hi> and then the ≈øoul is filled with horror of con≈øcience, as in ver≈øe 19. <hi>He is cha≈øtned al≈øo with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ≈øtrong pain.</hi> And when God hath done thus, then he ju≈øtifies him, and gives him faith, and ≈øhews him true righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, as in ver≈øe 23. <hi>If there be a me≈ø≈øenger with him, an interpreter one among a thou≈øand, to ≈øhew unto man his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightne≈øs;</hi> This is ju≈øtification, and when this is done, then the Lord comforts him, as in ver≈øe 25. <hi>His fle≈øh ≈øhall be fre≈øher than a childs, he ≈øhall return to the days of his youth.</hi> You ≈øee God comforts him in a way of free love; and in the 26. ver≈øe <hi>He ≈øhall pray unto God and he will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto him, and he ≈øhall ≈øee his face with joy, for he will render unto man his righteou≈øne≈øs.</hi> God comforts in a way of free love, he comforts how he plea≈øeth, and as far as he plea≈øeth; but when≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he comforts, it is ≈øtill I ≈øay in a way of free love. You may ≈øee it in <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 65.14. It is ≈øaid, <hi>Behold my ≈øervants ≈øhall ≈øing for joy of heart, but you ≈øhall cry for ≈øorrow of heart, and ≈øhall howl for vexation of ≈øpirit; and thus al≈øo ≈øaith the Lord</hi> in the former ver≈øe; <hi>Behold my ≈øervants
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57690:22"/>≈øhall eat, but ye ≈øhall be hungry, behold my ≈øervants ≈øhall drink, but ye ≈øhall be thir≈øty; behold my ≈øervants ≈øhall rejoyce, but ye ≈øhall be a≈øhamed.</hi> God comforts whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and as far as he plea≈øeth, and it is all free, out of free love; John 14.20. <hi>At that day you ≈øhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you:</hi> and at ver≈øe 16. <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</hi> This work of comforting is properly the work of the Holy Gho≈øt; and the Holy Gho≈øt breathes as the wind, where it li≈øteth; and therefore I ≈øay comforts whom and how he plea≈øeth, and all in a way of free love and free grace. That is the fourth particular.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Wherein is the love, the free love of God manife≈øted to us in the matter of our comforts? I an≈øwer in many things.</p>
            <p>I will pitch but upon three only.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greater he is that giveth, and the greater the thing is that is given, and the le≈ø≈øer or meaner the per≈øon is, that the thing is given unto, the more free is the love of him that gives and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtows the thing. Now this comfort and con≈øolation is a great thing, it is a very great matter, it is a birth of the Holy
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57690:22"/>Gho≈øt: Is that a ≈ømall thing? It is part of the Kingdom of God: Is that a ≈ømall matter? It is both duty and reward: Is that ≈ømall? It is that which exceeds all the Joy of the world: <hi>Lift up the light of thy countenance upon me: Thou ha≈øt put more gladne≈øs into my heart, more than in the time that their oyle and their wine Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed,</hi> P≈øalm 4.7. Ask a poor drooping ≈øoul, and he will tell you that it is a great thing, for it comes from a great God. I≈øaiah 57.15. <hi>For thus ≈øaith the high and lofty One, that inhabiteth eternity, who≈øe name is holy; I will dwell in the high and holy place, with him al≈øo that is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite and humble ≈øpirit, to revive the ≈øpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite Ones;</hi> Unto that ≈øoul that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, unto that ≈øoul will God bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and will be nigh unto him. Now if a Prince ≈øhould ri≈øe from his Throne, to come and help up a poor fallen Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; would it not be looked upon as an act of very great favour: Yet thus God does, when he comes to comfort, the great <hi>high and lofty One,</hi> comes down from his Throne, as it were to lift up a poor drooping ≈øoul: O what free grace is this! But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The more God doth cro≈øs hands,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57690:23"/>(under≈øtand me) the more I ≈øay that God doth cro≈øs hands in the matter of our comforts, the more doth the free grace of God appear in our comforts; when <hi>Jacob</hi> ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Jo≈øephs</hi> two children, <hi>he cro≈øt his hands, and he laid his right hand upon the younger, and his left hand upon the elder; not ≈øo father ≈øays</hi> Jo≈øeph; now what doth this ≈øhew but only the freene≈øs of his love; and ≈øo if God ≈øhall cro≈øs hands in the matter of our comfort, what doth this argue but the freene≈øs of his love, and grace; and God doth ≈øometimes do thus when he comes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he doth cro≈øs hands. Sometimes two men have been in the ≈øame tran≈øgre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and the one hath been comforted, and the other not: what ≈øhall we ≈øay of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of <hi>Francis Spira. Spira</hi> having profe≈ø≈øed the Truth, and being called to witne≈øs to it, did deny it; ≈øo did <hi>Peter,</hi> he denied Chri≈øt, yet <hi>Peter</hi> was comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>Spira</hi> never comforted, but lay de≈øpairing and roaring out to his death, <hi>I am a reprobate, I am a reprobate, no hope for me, no hope for me; Peter</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, <hi>Spira</hi> was never comforted: What do you think of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Cain, Cain</hi> murders his brother <hi>Abel</hi> a godly man; <hi>David</hi> murdered <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>riah</hi> a godly man too:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57690:23"/>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>riah</hi> had been with him in all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and was a very good man, but though <hi>David</hi> was an adulterer al≈øo, yet a me≈ø≈øenger is ≈øent to him that ≈øays, <hi>thy ≈øins are forgiven thee:</hi> but <hi>Cain</hi> not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, but driven out from the pre≈øence of the Lord. So that I ≈øay there may be two in a tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion, and the one may be comforted, and the other not. Look into the Scriptures, and into your own experiences, and you will find great ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners comforted, and le≈ø≈øer ≈øinners not comforted, and great ≈øinners converted and comforted ≈øooner than others. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> was a great ≈øinner, and yet was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: the <hi>Jaylor</hi> was a great ≈øinner, and yet comforted; and yet many that have walked very clo≈øely with God, have not been comforted. <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 88.15. <hi>Hemau</hi> complains ≈øadly in ver≈øe 14. <hi>Lord why ca≈øte≈øt thou off my ≈øoul, why hide≈øt thou thy face from me: I am afflicted and ready to dye from my youth up: while I ≈øuffer thy terrors I am di≈øtracted;</hi> and yet he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed clo≈øe with God, as you may find in the former part of the P≈øalm. Yet we find ≈øometimes (I ≈øay) the greate≈øt ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners converted and ≈øoone≈øt comforted. Now what is this but cro≈ø≈øing of hands in the matter of our comforts, and this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57690:24"/>is only to ≈øhew forth the freene≈øs of the grace of God; and the free grace and love of God is mo≈øt abundantly, mo≈øt eminently manife≈øted to the ≈øoul by this cro≈ø≈øing of hands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The more unbelieving any man is that is comforted, the more doth the freene≈øs of the grace of God appear. Dearly beloved Brethren, it is with our con≈øolation, as it is with our ju≈øtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and our ≈øanctification; when God comes to ju≈øtifie a man he finds him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, yet <hi>He ju≈øtifies the ungodly,</hi> and not only the ungodly, but the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving al≈øo; and therefore the Lord ≈øaid, <hi>Go and compel them to come in;</hi> They were unbelieving per≈øons, yet God calls them: And ≈øo it is al≈øo in the matter of our ≈øanctification; when God comes to ≈øanctify men, He finds them unwilling to be ≈øanctified; but as God ju≈øtifies them though unwilling, becau≈øe he doth it freely; ≈øo He ≈øanct fies them too though unwilling, becau≈øe he ≈øanctifies freely: And ≈øo it is al≈øo in the matter of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; when God comes to comfort, he finds the ≈øoul unwilling many times, <hi>my ≈øoul refu≈øed to be comforted</hi> ≈øaith the P≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øt <hi>P≈øalm</hi> 77.2. and ≈øo again, <hi>Remember the word unto thy ≈øervant, upon which thou
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57690:24"/>ha≈øt cau≈øed me to hope,</hi> P≈øalm 119.49. I was unwilling, but thou cau≈øed≈øt me to hope whether I would or no. When God comes to comfort, He doth it though men are unwilling to be comforted: It is very ≈øtrange that it ≈øhould be ≈øo, and yet ≈øuch is the unbelief of mens hearts, that as before conver≈øion they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be turned, ≈øo after conver≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are unwilling to be comforted. Now this is that I ≈øay, that the more unwilling any man is to be comforted, yet if God doth comfort him, the more free doth the grace of God appear in it; God doth comfort though ≈øouls are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing: O the freene≈øs, the freene≈øs of the grace of God, in the matter of our comforts. Thus you ≈øee how and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the free grace of God appears, and is manife≈øted in our ≈øpiritual comforts and con≈øolations. That is the fifth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Why will God deal with us in a way of free grace, in the matter of our comforts and con≈øolations? would it not be better in a way of ≈øettlement, in a con≈øtant way; would not that be be≈øt? No, take notice of this, that there is no way to make a mercy ≈øure like this; I know no mercy that is ≈øo ≈øure, as that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57690:25"/>which is wrought and given in a way of free grace, and free love, they go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Text; <hi>Everla≈øting Con≈øolation through Grace:</hi> The only way I ≈øay to make a thing ≈øure, is to receive it in this way, in which God gives it, that is, in a way of free grace. Pray tell me, did not God chu≈øe <hi>David</hi> freely, and his hou≈øe? Yea, it was freely in oppo≈øition to the hou≈øe of <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.21. Says <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Michal Sauls</hi> daughter, <hi>It was before the Lord, which cho≈øe me before thy Father, and before all his hou≈øe; to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God cho≈øe him freely, al≈øo in oppo≈øition to his own brethren: And was not his hou≈øe ≈øure; the covenant was ≈øure: 2 Sam. 23.5. <hi>Although my hou≈øe be not ≈øo with God, yet he hath made with me an everla≈øting covenant, ordered in all things and ≈øure, for this is all my ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and all my de≈øire.</hi> God hath made me his cho≈øen, and his mercies to me are ≈øure; God will deal with us in a way of free grace, that our mercies may be ≈øure; <hi>By grace ye are ≈øaved,</hi> and if ≈øo, what a comfort is it that God will ≈øo order and di≈øpo≈øe of it that we may be ≈øure of it, and depend upon it; for God will have us depend upon him for our ≈øpiritual
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57690:25"/>comforts, and what will make us more depend upon him, than to know that he gives all in a way of free grace; we mu≈øt depend upon God both for our ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and our outward comforts, ≈øeeing what He doth He doth freely; we mu≈øt freely depend upon him for comfort. But,</p>
            <p n="7">7. When may a man be ≈øaid to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted in a way of free grace? I cannot deny but I am comforted (≈øaith a poor ≈øoul) but I know not whether it be in a way of free grace and free love; now how may I know that I am comforted in a way of free grace.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to this <hi>Negatively</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt <hi>Negatively,</hi> There is a comfort that is the daughter of time; a man or woman is ≈øorrowful, but time wears it out, time comforts him; this comfort that ≈øprings from, and ari≈øeth out of time, is not true comfort; neither is that man truly comforted by free grace. But when the ≈øoul is truly comforted in a way of free grace, then he is comforted by the Holy Gho≈øt, <hi>the Holy Gho≈øt bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witne≈øs that he is the Child of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a comfort that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth from the ≈øatisfaction of a natural
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57690:26"/>con≈øcience: A man knows by nature, that there is a God, and that this God is to be prayed unto, and therefore he prayes accordingly; and when he hath done, his natural con≈øcience is ≈øatisfied, and he is then comforted; but no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> if a mans comfort ari≈øe only from this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>m the ≈øatisfaction of a naturall con≈øcience, that man is not truly comforted; for he that is truly comforted, is comforted by joy in believing: <hi>in whom believing ye rejoyce,</hi> Rom. 15.13.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a comfort that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth from a mans non-attendance to his own condition. Men may be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Why? Becau≈øe they never look into their condition, how it ≈øtands between God and their ≈øouls: There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ari≈øing not only from a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, but from the non-attendance to his own condition, and hereupon he is ≈øecure: but this is not the comfort that ari≈øeth from free grace and free love.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a comfort that doth ari≈øe from the u≈øe of the creature, men are troubled in their minds, and they run pre≈øently to the Tavern, to their Mu≈øick, or merry Company to put it off; and ≈øo it may be are comforted: but if a mans comfort ari≈øe only from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57690:26"/>he is not truly comforted, not comforted with the comfort of free grace and love: he that is comforted in this way, it is but a diver≈øion to him, and not true comfort: as ≈øtraw when ≈øet on fire will make a fla≈øh and a flame, but black a≈øhes remain behind; ≈øo when men are troubled, and they run to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, or to Mu≈øick, and merry Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; all this is but a fla≈øh, black A≈øhes remain behind: provoked trouble will be angry trouble, and angry will be mo≈øt trouble≈øome; when men run to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to divert trouble, they provoke it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is a comfort that doth ari≈øe from the common work of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gho≈øt; <hi>Some who have ta≈øted of the Heavenly gift, and are made partakers of the Holy Gho≈øt, and yet fall away, Heb.</hi> 6.4. The fal≈øe ground <hi>received the word with joy:</hi> Now if a mans comfort ari≈øeth from the≈øe common workings of the Holy Gho≈øt, it is not true comfort: for he that is truly comforted, is comforted in a way of free love, his comfort is un≈øpeakable, 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ≈øeen you love, in whom though you now ≈øee him not, yet believing ye rejoyce with joy un≈øpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and full of glory.</hi> Thus you ≈øee <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:57690:27"/>when a man is not truly comforted in the≈øe five particulars; a man is not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted from time, nor from the ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of a natural con≈øcience, nor from a non-attendance to his condition, nor from the u≈øe of the creature, nor la≈øtly from the common workings of the Holy Gho≈øt.</p>
            <p>But Secondly <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> we have heard when a man may be ≈øaid not to be comforted. Now when may a man be ≈øaid to be comforted, truly comforted in a way of free grace? Beloved in the Lord, are you willing to have your comforts tried; fal≈øe and counterfeit things do not love trial; now if you be willing to be tried, to have your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts tried, it is a ≈øign and a hope that your comforts may be true; but I ≈øhall not in≈øi≈øt on this. There are two or three things I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to here.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you have been comforted by the word of promi≈øe, ≈øet on upon your ≈øouls by God, then are you truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in away of love and free grace, for what is the promi≈øe but the word of grace. But ≈øome may ≈øay, I have had a promi≈øe, but I fear it may be from the Devil; for the Devil may bring a promi≈øe: did he not bring a pomi≈øe unto Chri≈øt, Mat. 4.6. <hi>Saying, He ≈øhall give His Angels charge over
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57690:27"/>thee, and in their hands they ≈øhall bear thee up.</hi> This promi≈øe was brought to Chri≈øt by the Devil, and it may be my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe may be handed to me by Satan, and ≈øet on upon my ≈øoul by him. But do but mark this, I will only ≈øay this one thing to thee, poor ≈øoul, to ea≈øe thee of this objection. If Satan bring a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe to you, it is to lead you into ≈øin, to draw you into ≈øin, and to that which is evil, as this to Chri≈øt here, <hi>He will give His Angels charge concerning Thee, ca≈øt thy ≈øelf down.</hi> He brought a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe to do evil, ca≈øt thy ≈øelf down: but now if God hand a promi≈øe to you, it is for your doing of good; therefore ≈øays Chri≈øt to Satan, <hi>It is written</hi> I have a word and a promi≈øe too, <hi>It is written thou ≈øhalt not tempt the Lord thy God:</hi> The Devil brought this that he might do evil, and God gave Chri≈øt a word to keep him from evil: and ≈øo when you are brought into temptations, great temptations; if you have a word of promi≈øe brought home to your hearts, to bear you up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptation; it is not the Devil that gives it in to you, that hands it to you: No, for the Devil is no friend to faith, no friend to ≈øtay you up; for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter will not act again≈øt the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57690:28"/>≈øaith <hi>Luther, though the Devil be Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, yet he is not Omnipotent; though he be Mighty, he is not Almighty:</hi> And therefore I ≈øay, if you have a promi≈øe comes to you, to help you to do good, it is not of Satan but of God; for he is Almighty, he is able to comfort. That is the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Would you know whether you be comforted in a way of free grace and love, you may know it by the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of your comforts, which will ebb and flow according to the cau≈øe: They ≈øay the <hi>Marygold</hi> opens and ≈øhuts with the Sun, when the Sun ≈øhines it opens, when the Sun with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws it ≈øhuts, it opens and ≈øhuts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the withdrawing and ≈øhining of the Sun: and ≈øo if your comforts be true, the more the righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt opens before you, the more the Sun of righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øhines upon you, the more you will be comforted: If your comforts be true, the more the freene≈øs of the love of God is opened to you, the more will the comfort of the ≈øoul be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged; if your comforts be true, the more God ≈øhines with his countenance, the more is the ≈øoul comforted: Lord ≈øaies <hi>David</hi> in P≈øalm 4.6. <hi>Lift up the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57690:28"/>light of thy countenance upon us, Thou ha≈øt put more gladne≈øs in my heart than in the time that their Corn and their wine increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed.</hi> Now according to the opening and ≈øhutting of the≈øe things, ≈øo will your comforts be. How is it therefore with you? Is there any ebbing and flowing? How is the righteou≈øne≈øs of Chri≈øt? How is the light of Gods countenance di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you? Are they laid open to you? Then are you truly comforted in a way of free grace and love. That is the ≈øecond.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you be comforted in a way of free grace and love, then your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are true friends to holine≈øs of life. That comfort that is wrought by the grace of God without you, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt friend to the grace of God within you, and to holine≈øs in your lives: Fal≈øe comfort is a friend to ≈øin, a neighbour; a guard to ≈øin; but no friend to true and gracious comfort; yea tho≈øe that have this fal≈øe comfort can indure ≈øins again≈øt con≈øcience: But now where there is true comfort, and comfort from the grace of God, there con≈øcience is as the Apple of the Eye, and the man cannot indure the lea≈øt ≈øin, he cannot bear the lea≈øt Mote of ≈øin to lie upon his con≈øcience: How
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57690:29"/>is it therefore with you? is your comfort a friend to holine≈øs of life? and can you ≈øay, the more comforted I am the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I am? Then you are truly comforted.</p>
            <p>But ≈øuppo≈øe I want comfort now, and that I am one of a drooping, trembling ≈øpirit, and of an afflicted heart; what ≈øhall I do that I may be comforted, and comforted in a way of free grace? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Go away, and be ≈øen≈øible of your unbelief; for it is want of believing that hinders our comfort, and when the comforter comes, he will convince the world of ≈øin, and e≈øpecially of unbelief: would you then be comforted in a way of free love? Go then I ≈øay, and be ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible of your unbelief, and be humbled for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Ob≈øerve what tho≈øe things are that hinder your ≈øpiritual comforts, and take heed of them. They are many. I will only name ≈øome of them. As,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Worldly fears, and worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; the≈øe are enemies to true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sins again≈øt con≈øcience, they that ≈øin again≈øt knowledge, will hardly have peace of con≈øcience; nay it is pitty they ≈øhould have peace, le≈øt they be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57690:29"/>ingaged and incouraged thereby to ≈øin; tho≈øe that ≈øin again≈øt Con≈øcience will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have peace. Do you think to have the Spirit to be your friend whom you grieve ≈øo often, if then you would be truly comforted, you mu≈øt have a great care of ≈øinning again≈øt con≈øcience, and thereby grieving the ≈øpirit, that <hi>≈øpirit whereby you are ≈øealed to the day of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 4.30. would you then be truly comforted? Ob≈øerve I ≈øay the≈øe things that hinder your ≈øpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: can you think that what you grieve mo≈øt, ≈øhould comfort you mo≈øt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you expect true comfort, have a care of grieving the ≈øpirit of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If at any time God make a tender of grace, or offer a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and peace to you; be ≈øure you do not refu≈øe it. We are apt to refu≈øe to be comforted; but be ≈øure you accept of it, e≈øpecially in a time of Temptation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be ≈øure you do not re≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your own performances in reference to your comforts. Brethren and Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved think on the≈øe things, and compare them with your own daily experiences. I ≈øay if you would be truly comforted, do not re≈øt on your own performances. As we are apt to re≈øt upon our own
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57690:30"/>Righteou≈øne≈øs, in reference to our Ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; ≈øo we are apt al≈øo to re≈øt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own performances, in reference to our comforts. O take heed you do not go about to e≈øtabli≈øh your own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts upon the bottom of your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, for if you do, you will not ≈øubmit to the con≈øolations of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would be comforted in a way of free grace and love, then ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy much the freene≈øs of the grace of God. What is the rea≈øon people are no more comforted? It is becau≈øe they ≈øee no more of the grace of God, the free grace of God: the more you look into the riches and freene≈øs of Gods grace, the more you will be comforted.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you want comfort at any time, walk graciou≈øly in the want of it. When you want comfort go to God and ≈øay; <hi>Lord although I cannot ≈øee thee, yet will I ≈øerve thee; and although I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy thee, yet I will obey thee; and although I cannot ≈øee thy face, yet I will follow after thee, if by any means I may obtain thee.</hi> Walk graciou≈øly in the want of your comforts.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Set your ≈øelf to rejoyce in him that gives you comfort, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alwaies, and again I ≈øay rejoyce,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57690:30"/>≈øaith the Apo≈øtle,</hi> Phil. 4.4. He doth not only ≈øay humble your ≈øelf for ≈øin, which is a duty and a great duty; but he ≈øaith <hi>Rejoyce, and again I ≈øay rejoyce in the Lord;</hi> Rejoyce in the Lord who gives you comfort freely. As much as you have been humbled for ≈øin formerly, ≈øo much ≈øhould you now rejoyce that you have been comforted, and freely comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the grace of God; Rejoyce ≈øo much in the Lord of your comforts.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, (To name them only:) If you would be comforted in a way of free grace and love, then be thankfull for your comfort: He that is thankfull for a little, ≈øhall have much; be thankfull therefore to God for your comfort.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, Would you be comforted in a way of free grace and love; then go to God for that comfort: Friends and Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; God is willing, mo≈øt willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and what will you not go to him? God is willing to make good his name, and his Title; now this is one of his Titles, I am the Lord that comforteth: He is willing to do what Chri≈øt was ≈øent to do; <hi>the ≈øpirit of the Lord is upon me to comfort all that mourn,</hi> I≈øa. 61.2. Is not God willing to do it; He hath ≈øent the comforter al≈øo to comfort you, yea he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57690:31"/>hath given his Mini≈øters charge to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you; <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> I≈øa. 40.1. and are not you willing now, to receive what God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, <hi>I will not leave you comfortle≈øs, I will come unto you.</hi> John 14.15. You will be troubled and rea≈øon with your ≈øelves, yet I will not leave you comfortle≈øs. <hi>As one whom his mother comforteth, ≈øo will I comfort you, and ye ≈øhall be comforted.</hi> I≈øa. 66.13. Therefore now O poor drooping ≈øoul go to God, for he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to comfort thee, if thou be but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go unto him. Only in your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God ob≈øerve the≈øe two or three directions.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, When you go to God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, go to the Office which he hath ≈øet up for comfort, the Office of the Holy-Gho≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When you go to God, ≈øhut your eyes, and ca≈øt your ≈øelf at an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the free grace of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In going to God for comfort you mu≈øt ≈øtay Gods lea≈øure; ≈øome come and ask of God, and becau≈øe they do not receive an an≈øwer pre≈øently, they are gone; but be ≈øure you do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øtay Gods lea≈øure. Thus I ≈øay, would you have comfort? you mu≈øt ob≈øerve
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57690:31"/>the≈øe things, to go to Gods Office, to ≈øhut your eyes, and to ca≈øt your ≈øelves at adventure upon the free grace of God, and then you mu≈øt ≈øtay Gods lea≈øure; Thus doing you ≈øhall be truly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and when you have obtained this comfort, and are thus truly comforted; Then take the≈øe few rules with you, and ≈øo I conclude.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Take as much pains to keep your comfort, as ever you did to get it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Labour more and more to increa≈øe it, for if it do not increate, it will certainly decrea≈øe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be comfortable to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of others; for how do you know but that God hath comforted you, to this very end that you might comfort others; <hi>Paul</hi> was ≈øo, and be ≈øure to ≈øhew comfort, for comforts ≈øake.</p>
            <p>Brethren and Beloved in the Lord, Do not receive this grace in vain; But go all you that have this comfort, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the riches of Gods grace, the freene≈øs of the grace of God that hath comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and ≈øay, <hi>What ≈øuch a one as I comforted! Others of thy Children Lord have walked clo≈øely with Thee, but I have walked loo≈øely; and ≈øhall I be comforted and not they? O what free grace is this! I have
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57690:32"/>been a great ≈øinner Lord, and what am I comforted? O what free grace is this! There are ≈øome that have walked in the light, and they are now in darkne≈øs; but I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the dark, and yet am now in the light, O what free grace is this!</hi> Go away therefore, and magnifie the riches of Gods grace in the matter of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard how the freene≈øs of the grace of God is written upon all your comforts, your comforts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolations are all deeply inamelled with the free grace of God; and that much of his free love is laid out in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and con≈øolations. And thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with the words of my Text, <hi>Now our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf, and God even our Father, which hath loved us, and given us Everla≈øting Con≈øolation and good hope through grace; Comfort your hearts and e≈øtabli≈øh you in every good word and work.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the former exerci≈øe I have been ≈øhewing you the freene≈øs of the love and grace of God, in the matter of our comforts and divine con≈øolations. I ≈øhall now in the third place ≈øhew you the freene≈øs of the grace of God, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to our ≈øalvation, and eternal glory, and therefore follow the≈øe words which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks at the latter end of ver≈øe 5. <hi>By grace are ye ≈øaved,</hi> and ≈øo you ≈øee the ≈øame in ver≈øe 8. <hi>For by grace are ye ≈øaved and that not of your ≈øelves; it is the gift of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why ≈øhould he ≈øay the ≈øame words again in ≈øo ≈øhort a compa≈øs? Why, it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57690:33"/>was to ≈øhew, not only that his heart was full of the free grace and love of God, but to ≈øhew al≈øo that he thought he could never ≈øpeak enough of it, and therefore he repeats it, <hi>by grace ye are ≈øaved; For by grace are ye ≈øaved:</hi> that is to ≈øay from fir≈øt to la≈øt, you are ≈øaved by the free grace and love of God.</p>
            <p>From whence then I take up this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That there is much of the free love and grace of God laid out in the matter of our ≈øalvation and eternal glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the clearing of this point, I ≈øhall endeavour to ≈øhew you,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That it is a matter of infinite happine≈øs, and of great concernment to go to Heaven and to be ≈øaved for ever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To ≈øhew you how this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is obtained, this mercy of ≈øalvation and eternal glory; I ≈øhall ≈øhew, it is of free grace and free love.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ≈øhall an≈øwer two Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you wherein the free grace and love of God appears in the matter of our ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Shew you why God chu≈øeth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57690:33"/>to ≈øave the children of men in a way of free love and grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ≈øhall ≈øpeak a little by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction: It is a great matter, and of infinite concernment to be ≈øaved, and to go to Heaven forever. For,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, You are thereby ≈øaved from wrath to come; you count it here a great matter to be delivered from the wrath of man; but it is a far greater mercy to be delivered from the wrath of Devils, to be delivered from their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and malice, and not to lye at their mercy to all Eternity. Yea,</p>
            <p>Secondly, You ≈øhall be delivered from all ≈øorrow, both inward and outward, and if ≈øo, how ble≈ø≈øed, and happy are you, for you ≈øhall die in the Lord; <hi>And ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed are the dead that die in the Lord, for they re≈øt from their labours,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev</hi> 14.13. It is a mercy to have meat and drink, and a bed to lye on, but it is a greater mercy not to need them; in Heaven you ≈øhall be freed from the≈øe needs and nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities. You walk here, but it is with a burden; you hear now, but it is with a burden; you repent now, but it is with a burden: But in Heaven you ≈øhall be freed, not only from the guilt of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of duty, but from the burden of duty
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57690:34"/>al≈øo, Heaven knows of no duty that hath a burden with it. Thus you ≈øhall be freed. Again,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You ≈øhall not only be freed from the≈øe troubles, but you ≈øhall al≈øo be brought into a po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, <hi>into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance that is incorruptible, that fadeth not away;</hi> where you ≈øhall enjoy the company of Saints and Angels, and that without ≈øu≈øpicion, or jealou≈øie one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: here you have the company of Saints, but either you ≈øu≈øpect them or they you, either they are jealous of you or you of them; but Heaven knows no ≈øu≈øpicions, no jealou≈øies; Saints live there without ≈øu≈øpicions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you go to Heaven and be ≈øaved, you ≈øhall then be filled with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: if you have but a little ta≈øte of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here you are ready to break under it, under a little glory; but the time will come, when you ≈øhall be filled with glory, and your hearts ≈øhall bear up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, your bodies ≈øhall be changed; <hi>your vile bodies ≈øhall be changed, and made like unto Chri≈øts glorious body;</hi> you ≈øhall be filled with glory, ≈øoul and body both. Yea,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you be ≈øaved, your graces ≈øhall be alwaies in Act, alwaies in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe; your under≈øtandings ≈øhall be fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57690:34"/>your difficulties ≈øhall be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you ≈øhall ≈øee them all little and ea≈øie unto you, and your wills, hearts and affections ≈øhall be drawn out to God, with infinite ≈øatisfaction and infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; <hi>I ≈øhall be ≈øatisfied when I awake with thy likene≈øs,</hi> P≈øalm 17.15. All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ari≈øeth from enjoying things ≈øuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, now what is more ≈øuitable for a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creature, than to enjoy his ends: when a Husband hath been at ≈øea from his wife half a year, or a year; what joy is it to her to ≈øee him come home again. So for a poor ≈øoul to ≈øee Chri≈øt, what joy is it after he hath withdrawn him≈øelf a great while? here we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chri≈øt but in part and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted; but then you ≈øhall be ever, for ever with the Lord, and have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him without interruption. Now we ≈øee joy and glory, but darkly; and if there be ≈øo much ≈øweetne≈øs to ≈øee Chri≈øt in a gla≈øs; O then what ≈øweetne≈øs will it be to ≈øee him face to face, and enjoy him for ever; And to ≈øay no more,</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, If you be ≈øaved, you ≈øhall have the knowledge of the continuance of this condition: Though a mans condition be never ≈øo happy in it ≈øelf, yet if he think it will not continue,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57690:35"/>that man is unhappy in the mid≈øt of his happine≈øs; this is the unhappine≈øs of Hell, men ≈øhall know and be a≈ø≈øured that they ≈øhall never be delivered out of it, never, never, never; and this is the happine≈øs of Heaven, that men ≈øhall alwayes rejoyce, and ≈øhall be a≈ø≈øured that they ≈øhall ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do, ever, ever, ever.</p>
            <p>But 2. In what way does a man come to this attainment, how and in what way is a man ≈øaved? Why in a way of free love and grace, for if God be≈øtow any thing in a way of gift it is free, for what is more free than gift; now do but con≈øider what tho≈øe things are, which are called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Salvation, and you may ob≈øerve, that they all come in a way of gift.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes Salvation is put for the Author of Salvation, Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Lord now lette≈øt thou thy ≈øervant depart in peace, according to thy word, for mine eyes have ≈øeen thy ≈øalvation:</hi> Luke 2.29, 30. That is Chri≈øt the Author of our ≈øalvation; and ≈øo ≈øaith Chri≈øt to <hi>Zacheus, This day is ≈øalvation come to thy hou≈øe;</hi> That is Chri≈øt. Now this ≈øalvation is obtained in a way of gift, <hi>Saith Chri≈øt to the woman of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, if thou had≈øt known the gift of God, and who it is that ≈øaith unto thee give me to drink,</hi> &amp;c. John. 4.10. He calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57690:35"/>the gift of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sometimes Salvation is put for the means of ≈øalvation, for the Go≈øpel; <hi>How ≈øhall we e≈øcape if we neglect ≈øo great ≈øalvation.</hi> Heb. 2.3. that is the means of ≈øalvation, the go≈øpel: this ≈øalvation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo called the gift of God; <hi>unto you it is given to know the my≈øteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Mat. 13.11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Sometimes ≈øalvation is put for eternal glory, <hi>who would have all men to be ≈øaved, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and this ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the gift of God too. Rom. 6.23. <hi>But the gift of God is eternal life, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt our Lord;</hi> Now ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as to the Author of it, as to the means of it, and as to the ≈øalvation it ≈øelf, it is all of free grace, all given in a way of free love and grace; and therefore it mu≈øt needs be, that much of the free grace and love of God is laid out in our ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, if it be ≈øo, that by free grace we are ≈øaved, then what need we u≈øe the means of ≈øalvation; you ≈øay we are ≈øaved by grace, by free grace; wherefore then need we indeavour.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Yes we are to indeavour; do you not u≈øe your indeavour to get your daily bread? and yet that is the gift of God:
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57690:36"/>your livelihood is the gift of God; for you ≈øay, <hi>give us this day our daily bread;</hi> it is then the gift of God, and yet we are to u≈øe the means: and ≈øo we are to do what we can, although not what we ≈øhould in the matter of our ≈øalvation; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe by our endeavour, and u≈øing the means we ≈øhew our dependance upon God, and our obedience to him, becau≈øe he hath commanded it; For,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although I ≈øay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, <hi>by grace ye are ≈øaved, and not of works:</hi> yet works are nece≈ø≈øary, good works are nece≈ø≈øary in regard of our thankfulne≈øs to God; and nece≈ø≈øary as they are an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our ≈øalvation, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, although I ≈øay by grace ye are ≈øaved, yet you are to be in the performance of good works; Eph. 2.10. <hi>For we are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man≈øhip created in Chri≈øt Je≈øus unto good works;</hi> the ≈øame word, <hi>good works:</hi> that is the third general. But.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Wherein doth the freene≈øs of the grace of God appear, in the matter of our ≈øalvation?</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, There is a great deal of free grace in this, that God ≈øhould ordain us to eternal life and ≈øalvation. 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ≈øaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57690:36"/>but according to his own purpo≈øe and grace, which was given us in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, before the world began.</hi> Again</p>
            <p>Secondly, (To name them) Is it not great grace, mercy, and favour that God ≈øhould ≈øend his own Son from Heaven to dye for us, and to purcha≈øe our ≈øalvation, yet ≈øo he did. <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> what price? <hi>the blood of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who gave him≈øelf a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome for you,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is it not a great mercy, a very great favour, that we that had broken the fir≈øt Covenant, and had not performed the conditions of it, that we ≈øhould be ≈øet up again as I may ≈øay; That God ≈øhould ≈øet us up again, under another Covenant, that runs without any condition; and yet ≈øo he did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the hou≈øe of I≈ørael, after tho≈øe days ≈øaith the Lord, I will put my Law into their mind and write them in their heart, and I will be to them a God, and they ≈øhall be to me a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Yet further It is in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our ≈øalvation, as it is in the matter of our con≈øolation, and comfort; and as I ≈øaid of that ≈øo I ≈øay al≈øo of this. That the greater, and the more glorious any
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57690:37"/>mercy is, &amp; the more worthy and great the per≈øon is that giveth it, and the more unworthy the per≈øon is that receives it, the more doth the grace of him appear who giveth it; now what greater mercy, what more glorious mercy, than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ≈øalvation. It is called <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> it is called, <hi>the Kingdom of glory, and Eternal glory,</hi> it is called Joy, <hi>Enter into the Joy of our Lord: and great is the Joy of our Lord;</hi> That Joy which was ≈øet before Chri≈øt, that is the Joy of the Saints in Heaven, <hi>It is ≈øuch as eye hath not ≈øeen, ear hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. Paul was wrapt up to Heaven, but when he came down he was not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the glory thereof; Tho≈øe that are in a war are better able to declare the pa≈ø≈øages of it than tho≈øe that write it, but yet they are not able to declare all. So the Apo≈øtle could ≈øpeak ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this great and infinite glory, but was not able to declare it all. There was one, who was asked by his Prince, <hi>what God was,</hi> he de≈øired fir≈øt, two dayes to an≈øwer, when they were pa≈øt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57690:37"/>he required four dayes, and after four dayes, he asked eight dayes to an≈øwer; So if you ≈øhould ask me what glory that is, which is in my Text, I mu≈øt take two dayes, and then four dayes, and then eight dayes to an≈øwer, and yet then I ≈øhould not be able to declare, nor be able to expre≈øs, this glory which is wrapt up in this one word <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be this ble≈ø≈øed E≈øtate is be≈øtowed only upon tho≈øe that are worthy? No not ≈øo, this is mo≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be≈øtowed upon tho≈øe that are mo≈øt unworthy: what is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy than a Dog? why, was not Stephen looked upon as a Dog? yea were not the Gentiles looked upon as Dogs? ≈øaith Chri≈øt; <hi>Why ca≈øt ye the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread to Dogs?</hi> Now though Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was of the Jews, for Chri≈øt came of the Jews, yet Salvation is now for the Gentiles; and among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; who was more unworthy than a bla≈øphemer, and a per≈øecutor of the Saints and Servants of God, and ≈øuch a one was Paul, and yet he was ≈øaved, though he was not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øerving of it, but de≈øerving the quite contrary; now who more unde≈øerving than tho≈øe that de≈øerve the contrary?
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57690:38"/>yet by grace even they are ≈øaved, therefore ≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt, P≈øal. 8.3. <hi>When I con≈øider thy Heavens, the work of thy ≈øingers, the Moon and the Stars which thou ha≈øt ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him, and the Son of Man that thou vi≈øite≈øt him,</hi> &amp;c. So I ≈øay, that the more glorious any mercy is, and the more unworthy the receiver is, and the greater he is that gives, the more free is the thing given, and thus it is with our Salvation. Salvation is a great, and glorious mercy, and this Salvation is given, and that is great and glorious too, and it is given unto man who is mo≈øt unworthy, and 'tis given by God who is mo≈øt infinite and excellent above us. But again</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The more God doth cro≈øs hands in the matter of our Salvation, the more free is his grace, in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtowing of it upon us: for as I ≈øhewed you before, that God doth cro≈øs hands in the matter of our comforts, ≈øo I ≈øay now, that God doth cro≈øs hands in the matter of our Salvation al≈øo; For he doth often ≈øave them that are mo≈øt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be ≈øaved, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew the Publican,</hi> and who more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely than <hi>Zacheus</hi> or the <hi>Thiefe</hi> on the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57690:38"/>cro≈øs, or the <hi>Jaylor?</hi> yet were the≈øe ≈øaved, though very unlikely to be ≈øav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And ≈øo on the contrary, who more likely to be ≈øaved, than the young man in the Go≈øpel, that came to Chri≈øt, yet you know he was rejected: the young man he comes unto Chri≈øt, and ≈øays, Matt. 19.16. <hi>Good Ma≈øter what good thing ≈øhall I do, that I may have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, ≈øays</hi> Chri≈øt, <hi>keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all the≈øe things have I kept, ≈øaith he, from my youth upward; then ≈øaith Chri≈øt, Go ≈øell all that thou ha≈øt, and then thou ≈øhall have trea≈øures in heaven, and it is ≈øaid he went away ≈øorrowful.</hi> Mark now, was not this a forward young man, a very forward man, <hi>all the≈øe ≈øaith he have I kept from my youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and Chri≈øt doth not contradict him, and yet notwith≈øtanding, this man could not do what Chri≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, he could not ≈øell all he had, it was too hard for him to learn that le≈ø≈øon which Chri≈øt ≈øet him, for it is ≈øaid he went away ≈øorrowful; and and therefore ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>a rich man ≈øhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And what is this but only to ≈øhew, that God doth often cro≈øs hands in the matter of our Salvation,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57690:39"/>to ≈øhew that <hi>the fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt, and the la≈øt fir≈øt,</hi> for God loves to cro≈øs hands in the matter of our Salvation; and therefore we find in Scripture, that there are ≈øome that come to Chri≈øt and ≈øay as the Scribe in Matt. 8.19. <hi>Ma≈øter I will follow thee where≈øoever thou goe≈øt,</hi> and Chri≈øt ≈øeems to put him off, and yet in the next ver≈øe almo≈øt he puts one forward, and he excu≈øes him≈øelf, and ≈øayes, <hi>≈øuffer me to bury my Father,</hi> but Chri≈øt ≈øaith <hi>follow me</hi> &amp;c. Thus you ≈øee what cro≈ø≈øing of hands there is in matter of our Salvation, to ≈øhew <hi>the fir≈øt ≈øhall be la≈øt I ≈øay, and the la≈øt fir≈øt:</hi> Friends, ≈øtay but a little while, until the day of Judgement, and then you will ≈øee what cro≈ø≈øing of hands there will be, then you ≈øhall ≈øee ≈øome men at the right hand of Chri≈øt, whom you thought would never have been ≈øaved, and then al≈øo you ≈øhall ≈øee ≈øome on the left hand of Chri≈øt, whom you would have thought would never have been there. God I ≈øay will cro≈øs hands in the matter of our Salvation, and the more he doth ≈øo, the more doth the freene≈øs of his grace appear to them that are ≈øaved. Again</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Yet one thing more, The
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57690:39"/>more our Salvation is layd upon the Arch or Pillar of grace and love, the more free is the grace of God, and the more free it doth appear in the be≈øtowing of it: Now what are the Arches and Pillars of free grace and love, upon which our Salvation under Chri≈øt is layd. I ≈øhall name ≈øome.
<list>
                  <item>1. The ab≈øolutene≈øs of the Covenant.</item>
                  <item>2. That God ju≈øtifies the ungodly.</item>
                  <item>3. That our righteou≈øne≈øs is not in us but in Chri≈øt.</item>
                  <item>4. That the guilt of our ≈øins by which we lay lyable to condemnation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</item>
                  <item>5. That a little ≈øincerity covers a great deal of Infirmity.</item>
                  <item>6. That what God calls ours is not indeed ours, but Gods, as our graces, our duties, which are not indeed ours but Gods.</item>
                  <item>7. That God will in due time glori≈øy us and honour us.</item>
               </list> Sin doth provoke God, and cau≈øeth him to be angry with us, but grace doth provoke him to love us, and therefore the Pillars of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are layd under Chri≈øt upon grace, upon free-grace and love, and thereby the freene≈øs of the grace of God doth the more appear in the matter of our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57690:40"/>Salvation, and that is the fourth General. But then</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Salvation is a work of grace; and ≈øeeing we are ≈øaved by grace alone, why then doth God chu≈øe to ≈øave men in this way of free-grace? I An≈øwer,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is becau≈øe this is the mo≈øt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable way unto God; the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> are not a≈øhamed to ≈øay that it is mo≈øt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a man to be ≈øaved by his works, but I am ≈øure it is more honour, and more honourable unto God to ≈øave by his free-grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If there was ≈øomewhat of the good plea≈øure of God in the worlds condemnation, all the rea≈øon in the world then that there ≈øhould be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace in the way of Salvation. Pray how came Adam to ≈øtand for the whole world? He was not cho≈øen by us, why it was the good plea≈øure of God that he ≈øhould ≈øtand for the whole world, and that he ≈øinning, we ≈øhould all be guilty of ≈øin by, and through him: So I ≈øay, if there was (as I may ≈øpeak with reverence) ≈øomewhat of the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of God in the old worlds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, why then ≈øhould there not be free-grace in the ≈øouls Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. <hi>But not as the offence, ≈øo al≈øo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57690:40"/>is the free-gift, for if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift of grace which is by one man, Je≈øus Chri≈øt, hath abounded unto many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, God would have Heaven and Salvation to be of one peice, he would have the work of heaven to be all the ≈øame; Now there were many Angels that fell, and many thou≈øands that ≈øtood, why how came they to ≈øtand, that did ≈øtand, more than the others that fell; it was only by free grace, they were Elect Angels. Now men and Angels in heaven are of the ≈øame Quire, and ≈øing the ≈øame ≈øong; and therefore tho≈øe men that are fated, O who are they? why they are the Elect, and they have great cau≈øe to glorifie the grace, the free grace of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God ≈øaves men in a way of free love, and grace, becau≈øe none ≈øhall mi≈øs of Salvation: As God will puni≈øh, and condemn all the proud, all the wicked, that none ≈øhall e≈øcape; So he will al≈øo ≈øave all that he hath a mind to ≈øave, by free grace, becau≈øe they ≈øhall not mi≈øs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God will ≈øave men in ≈øuch a way as whereby he may be glorified to all Eternity, and therefore he ≈øaves them in a way of free grace and love; For what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57690:41"/>have we to prai≈øe God for, in heaven, but only for <hi>free grace, free grace,</hi> to glorify his name for that; therefore I ≈øay God will ≈øave men in this way of free love and grace, that he may be thereby glorified hereafter to all Eternity, and thus I have done with the Doctrine; Now go along with me a little by way of application.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If we be ≈øaved by free grace, if free grace and love be the foundation of our Salvation, why ≈øhould we not then ≈øtand cleer from all our own works, as to the meritorious ends of them: for grace and works are oppo≈øed, and therefore faith as a work can neither Ju≈øtify nor ≈øave. I confe≈øs the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>work out your own Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, but what follows, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good plea≈øure, Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we be ≈øaved by grace, why ≈øhould we not be tender of the grace of God, of the name of God, of the free grace of God, and of the great name of God; Are you ≈øaved by grace, and will you turn grace into wantonne≈øs? Oh my friends I ≈øay, if you be ≈øaved by grace, and by grace alone, how tender ≈øhould you be of the name of God and of the free grace of God.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57690:41"/>
            <p>Thirdly, If we be ≈øaved by grace, then we may here ≈øee the rea≈øon, why many do take ≈øo much pains, as they think, for heaven, and yet fall ≈øhort of it, and go to Hell; why it is becau≈øe Salvation lies under the conduct of free grace: Some men ab≈øtain from ≈øin, that they may not be damned, others perform holy duties, read and hear, &amp;c. That they may go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yea <hi>many ≈øtrive and ≈øhall not enter,</hi> becau≈øe ≈øalvation is of free grace.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If by grace ye are ≈øaved, and that there is much of the free grace of God in our ≈øalvation, why then ≈øhould you doubt of it: I confe≈øs it is a hard thing to have A≈ø≈øurance of your ≈øalvation, and if you have it, it is free grace to you more than to another, and free grace is the founder of it if you have it: But yet, O ≈øoul, if by grace we are ≈øaved, let us not then doubt of it, for it is mo≈øt ≈øure: if you are ≈øaved by grace I ≈øay, why doubt ye then O ye of little faith. O Chri≈øtians comfort your ≈øelves with the≈øe words, <hi>It is your Fathers good plea≈øure to give you the Kingdom,</hi> Luke 12.32. It is his good will and plea≈øure, it is in a way of free grace and love.</p>
            <p>But you may ≈øay though it be in a way of free grace and love, yet it may not be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57690:42"/>for me, it may none of it be mine, ≈øaith the ≈øoul.</p>
            <p>Nay ≈øay not ≈øo, but mark what an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the P≈øalmi≈øt makes, and draws up from this General. P≈øalm 130.4, 5. <hi>But there is forgivene≈øs with thee, that thou may≈øt be feared. I wait for the Lord, my ≈øoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope:</hi> and ≈øo in P≈øal. 103. Speaking at large of the grace, mercy and goodne≈øs of God, in the 8. ver≈øe he ≈øaith. <hi>The Lord is merciful and gracious, ≈ølow to anger, and plenteous in mercy:</hi> but what is the conclu≈øion, <hi>Ble≈øs the Lord all ye his ho≈øts, ble≈øs the Lord all his works, Ble≈øs the Lord O my ≈øoul.</hi> The very la≈øt words are, <hi>ble≈øs the Lord O my Soul:</hi> from the con≈øideration of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the grace of God in general, he draws up this Conclu≈øion, ble≈øs the Lord O my Soul.</p>
            <p>But you may ≈øay: Though God will ≈øave by grace, yet ≈øurely all ≈øhall not be ≈øaved by grace; ≈øhall all men be ≈øaved? is God ≈øo free?</p>
            <p>No, all men ≈øhall not be ≈øaved, <hi>for</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle Gal. 5.15. <hi>We through the ≈øpirit wait for the hope of righteou≈øne≈øs by faith; for in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, neither circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion availeth any thing nor uncircumci≈øion, but the new creature:</hi> but ≈øhall not all be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57690:42"/>≈øaved? No ≈øaith the ≈øame Apo≈øtle, Eph. 5.6. <hi>Let no man deceive you, for no whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, nor unclean per≈øon, &amp;c. hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chri≈øt, and of God.</hi> There is no place for unclean things in Heaven: you know what the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith to the <hi>Galathians, The inheritance is not to the bondwoman nor to her children.</hi> So that I ≈øay, that God doth not ≈øave all, but tho≈øe he doth ≈øave, are ≈øaved by free grace.</p>
            <p>But you would know who tho≈øe are that are ≈øaved, or that ≈øhall be ≈øaved for ever; why, thus briefly, only to name things,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Look who tho≈øe are that are ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, they ≈øhall be certainly ≈øaved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Tho≈øe that are willing to part with all for Chri≈øt, and for the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chri≈øt; they ≈øhall certainly be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Mat. 19.29. <hi>And every one that hath for≈øaken hou≈øes, or brethren, or ≈øi≈øters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands for my name ≈øake, ≈øhall receive an hundred fold, and ≈øhall inherit everla≈øting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, They that ≈øtand at Chri≈øts right hand here, they ≈øhall be ≈øure to ≈øtand at Chri≈øts right hand, at the day of judgement; and ≈øo be ≈øaved. 2 Cor. 5.5.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57690:43"/>
               <hi>Now he that hath wrought us for the ≈øelf ≈øame thing is God, who al≈øo hath given unto us the earne≈øt of his ≈øpirit; he that hath wrought us for the ≈øelf ≈øame thing:</hi> it is the very ≈øame word which is u≈øed for <hi>work out your own ≈øalvation,</hi> &amp;c. So that there is a working up of the ≈øoul unto eternal glory; and if Chri≈øt hath wrought you unto the ≈øelf ≈øame thing, whil≈øt you live here, then you are at his right hand now; and then you may be ≈øure to ≈øtand at his right hand, at the day of judgement, and ≈øo ≈øhall be ≈øure to be ≈øaved for ever to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Tho≈øe that are tender to Chri≈øts little ones, that are tender to tho≈øe that are de≈øpi≈øed in this world, and ready to help and a≈ø≈øi≈øt them according to their wants, they ≈øhall ≈øurely be ≈øaved for ever: <hi>Come ye ble≈ø≈øed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thir≈øty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ≈øtranger<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and ye took me in; I was naked, and ye cloathed me; ≈øick, and ye vi≈øited me; in pri≈øon, and ye came unto me. And the righteous an≈øwer, Lord when did we ≈øee thee ≈øick, or naked, or hungry, and fed thee, and cloathed thee:</hi> why ≈øaith he, <hi>In as much as you did it to one of the lea≈øt of the≈øe my
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57690:43"/>brethren, ye have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25.35. So I ≈øay, look who the≈øe are, that are tender of Chri≈øts little ones, and are ready to help them, and to relieve them according to their wants and nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities; tho≈øe are they that ≈øhall be ≈øaved to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Tho≈øe that <hi>≈øtrive together for the Faith in times of affliction,</hi> tho≈øe are they that ≈øhall be ≈øaved for ever. Phil. 1.27. <hi>That ye ≈øtand fa≈øt in one ≈øpirit, with one mind, ≈øtriving together for the faith of the Go≈øpel.</hi> So I ≈øay, look who tho≈øe are, that in the time of per≈øecution, ≈øtrive for the faith, they ≈øhall ≈øurely be ≈øaved, and that to all eternity. Yet one thing more.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Tho≈øe that come to Chri≈øt in time of Temptation, they ≈øhall be ≈øaved free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all eternity: for ≈øaith our Saviour Chri≈øt: John 6.39. <hi>And this is my Fathers will that hath ≈øent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ≈øhould lo≈øe nothing, but ≈øhould rai≈øe it up again at the la≈øt day;</hi> in ver≈øe 37. ≈øaies Chri≈øt, <hi>him that cometh to me, I will in no wi≈øe ca≈øt out,</hi> and I will give you the rea≈øon ≈øaith he, <hi>For it is the will of my Father that I ≈øhould lo≈øe none which he hath given unto me, but that they ≈øhould ri≈øe at the la≈øt day.</hi> How is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57690:44"/>with you, (Holy and beloved bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Lord)? Do you come to Chri≈øt in your Temptations? Do you ≈øtrive together in love for the faith, in time of per≈øecution? Are you tempted? Are you brought low? Remember this, that Chri≈øt is able to rai≈øe you up, and to ≈øave you to all eternity; and therefore O ≈øoul doubt not of your ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p>But ≈øome may ≈øay, I am guilty of this doubting, what ≈øhall I do that I may not doubt of my ≈øalvation?</p>
            <p>This is too large a ≈øubject to ≈øpeak to now, I ≈øhall only ≈øay this to it. Let me de≈øire you to ≈øtudy much, the freene≈øs of the grace of God in general; and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der al≈øo much, and frequently, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in≈øtances of grace and mercy, that God hath ≈øhewn to others, and you will find it is all of free grace; yea and this ≈øcripture ≈øhews you that all is of free grace; and therefore though it be a hard thing for us to get a≈ø≈øurance of our ≈øalvation, yet the particular in≈øtances, and examples of the mercies that God hath be≈øtowed upon others, ≈øhould much incourage us, and bear us up, and ≈øhould ≈øtir us up to get a≈ø≈øurance. Grace and mercy being ≈øhewn to others doth not only ≈øhew that it may be had,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57690:44"/>but that mercy hath been had. When you ≈øee the Ice trodden, then you ≈øay you will venture: So ≈øay, ≈øuch a one was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, ≈øuch a one prophane, and yet he hath obtained mercy, and why may not I? Therefore if you would have a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance of your ≈øalvation, think much of the freene≈øs of the grace of God; and withal con≈øider the particular in≈øtances, and examples of others, that have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this mercy, and that in a way of free grace and love too.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And la≈øtly to conclude, Is it ≈øo, that God ≈øaves the ≈øoul freely, and that our ≈øalvation is only by the free grace and love of God? Why then ≈øhould we not come with boldne≈øs for ≈øalvation, ≈øince it is ≈øo free; O let none be di≈øcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, but let it ≈øtir us up to come with boldne≈øs, and to plead for it, if it be free; Is ≈øalvation free, and will not poor ≈øinners come to receive it? Come, O come freely for ≈øalvation, Chri≈øt Je≈øus is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make good his own name, and this is his name, he is called <hi>Je≈øus, and he ≈øhall ≈øave his people.</hi> This is the will al≈øo of my Father, that you ≈øhould come unto me, <hi>John</hi> 6. Chri≈øt Je≈øus hath now ≈øalvation in his hands, and will you not come and ask for it? But methinks I ≈øee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57690:45"/>≈øalvation in your faces; methinks I hear a voice among you, ≈øaying, <hi>What ≈øhall we do to be ≈øaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In an≈øwer to which thus: <hi>Believe in the Lord Je≈øus,</hi> and venture your ≈øalvation upon him.</p>
            <p>And then if you will be ≈øaved, you mu≈øt become as little children; for ≈øaith our Saviour, <hi>unle≈øs you become as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you cannot be ≈øaved.</hi> Mat. 18.3. <hi>You cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> As little children, how? Why, not ≈øeeking great things; Little children do not ≈øeek great things, you mu≈øt become as little children, low and humble, not ≈øeeking great things, for great things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not little children; You mu≈øt be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with all at Chri≈øts command, and for his ≈øervice; and for want of this the young man went away without eternal life: <hi>Go and ≈øell all that thou halt, and follow me, and he could not do it;</hi> and he lo≈øt Heaven by it; he would keep Earth, and he lo≈øt Heaven by it. But once more,</p>
            <p>Be not only willing to part with all for Chri≈øts ≈øake, and at his command; but go and ca≈øt your ≈øelf at adventure upon his free grace and love, and then go and work, and perform duties, and pray, and u≈øe indeavour; work as if there were no
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57690:45"/>grace to be ≈øaved by, and bear thy ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> ≈øtill upon free grace; work as if the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> were no grace, and build upon the grace of God, as though there were no works. Thus do, and you ≈øhall be freely ≈øaved to all Eternity, for ever, and for ever.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But ≈øo did not I, becau≈øe of the fear of God.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter, there are three things mo≈øt con≈øiderable.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The voice or cry, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter; <hi>And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives, again≈øt their Brethren the Jews.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p>Secondly, You have made known to you, what <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did in this ca≈øe, in the 6, and 7, ver≈øes, <hi>And I was very angry when I heard their cry, and the≈øe words, then I con≈øulted with my ≈øelf, and I rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Nobles, and the Rulers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You hear more of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> acting at the 14, and 15 ver≈øes, <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57690:46"/>from that time that I was appointed to be their Governour in the Land of</hi> Judah, <hi>from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>the King, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the Governour: For the former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that had been before me, were charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, be≈øide forty ≈øhekels of ≈øilver, yea even their ≈øervants bare rule over the people: But ≈øo did not I, becau≈øe I feared God, becau≈øe of the fear of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence then ob≈øerve this Truth or Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That tho≈øe that truly fear God will not do as others do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true fear of God will keep men from doing tho≈øe things that other men will do; yea, though an action be to a mans advantage, yet they that fear God will not do it, if it be evil; and ≈øo it was with <hi>Nehemiah. But ≈øo did not I, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the fear of God.</hi> For the opening of this we ≈øhall,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Inquire what it is to fear God; and we ≈øhall,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Shew you that a man that truly fears God, will do as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57690:47"/>neither can he do as others do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ≈øhall ≈øhew you, what there is in this fear of God, that doth lay ≈øuch a ballance upon mens hearts, that they cannot do as others do.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We ≈øhall an≈øwer this Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether a man that fears God, may not ≈øometimes do as others do.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you the I≈ø≈øue and Con≈øequence of this Truth.</p>
            <p>And then I ≈øhall make ≈øome Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you ask what this fear of God is, I an≈øwer in the general. <hi>That it is a pa≈ø≈øion of the ≈øoul whereby a man doth flee from eminent evil.</hi> But now further, if you ask me what the fear of God is. I ≈øay that it is twofold.</p>
            <p>A ≈øervile fear, And</p>
            <p>A ≈øilial fear.</p>
            <p>A ≈øervile fear, whereby a man fears God upon the account of Hell, or Judgement, or becau≈øe of the wrath of God.</p>
            <p>But now a fear of God, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of his Judgements, but becau≈øe of di≈øplea≈øing of him, becau≈øe of his love, becau≈øe we would not offend; This is a ≈øilial fear, to fear him becau≈øe we would not do contrary to his commands; and thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he would have
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57690:47"/>offered up his ≈øon <hi>I≈øaac: For ≈øaith God,</hi> Gen. 22.12. <hi>By this I know thou feare≈øt God,</hi> becau≈øe he obeyed his command, and was afraid to do contrary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This fear of God, this filial fear, is not only becau≈øe of his love, but of his love in conjunction with his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs al≈øo: The greater a man is, the more we fear him, and the nearer he is in relation to us, the more we reverence him. Yet further, as the love of God in conjunction with his greatne≈øs, calls for our fear; So al≈øo.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The word and works of God call for our fear; For the word of the Lord is mighty, and his works are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; For it is ≈øaid of God, <hi>That he is fearful in prai≈øes, working wonders.</hi> Thus if you ask me what this filial fear is, I ≈øay it is a fear whereby we fear him, becau≈øe of his love, becau≈øe of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and becau≈øe of his word and works. That is the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A man that truly fears God, cannot do as others can do; for in the Text we find that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in his hand, to <hi>make</hi> him≈øelf, to <hi>rai≈øe</hi> him≈øelf, to make him≈øelf rich, as to outward things: But you ≈øee what he ≈øaith, <hi>But ≈øo did not I,</hi> as others did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57690:48"/>I feared God; where the true fear of God is planted in a mans heart, he cannot, he will not do, as other men can and will do: I ≈øhall cleer this to you by in≈øtancing in ≈øome particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He that fears God, cannot do as others do in the matter of his choice; you know how it was with the Dam≈øel, the daughter of <hi>Herodias, Mat.</hi> 14.7, 8. when ≈øhe had danced before <hi>Herod,</hi> He was ≈øo delighted with her, that he gave her this priviledge, to choo≈øe what ≈øhe would, to the half of his Kingdom, and ≈øhe asked the Head of <hi>John</hi> the Bapti≈øt. She was bad, and her choice was bad; not having the fear of God in her heart. But when <hi>F≈øther</hi> had her choice, ≈øhe cho≈øe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for ≈øhe cho≈øe the freedom of <hi>John</hi> the Bapti≈øt, in the freedom of the <hi>Jews:</hi> ≈øhe acted not as the other did, becau≈øe of the fear of God; They that fear the Lord cannot do as others do. I may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> al≈øo, he would not do as others; for ≈øaith he, <hi>I will choo≈øe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ≈øuffer Afflictions with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea≈øures of ≈øin for a ≈øea≈øon,</hi> Heb. 11.25. And why did he thus? but only becau≈øe of the fear of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As they that fear God, will not do as others do in the matter of their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57690:48"/>choice; ≈øo neither will they do as others do in the matter of wor≈øhip: for what ≈øaith <hi>Jo≈øhua, As for me and my hou≈øhold, we will ≈øerve the Lord;</hi> Jo≈øh. 24.15. <hi>Do you what you plea≈øe. Therefore fear the Lord, and ≈øerve him in ≈øincerity and truth, and put away the Gods which your Father ≈øerved, or the gods of</hi> Amorites, <hi>in who≈øe land ye dwell; but as for me and my hou≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, we will ≈øerve the Lord.</hi> As for me I will wor≈øhip God, wor≈øhip you whom you will; thus you ≈øee what they will do that fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Will you in≈øtance in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your callings, for a man really is what he is in his calling, in his trade; or will you in≈øtance in the divine calling, you know what the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith; Some ≈øaith he, <hi>Preach Chri≈øt out of envy, and ≈øome out of good will,</hi> ≈øome to get a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood by it, to make a trade of it, to get riches, and honours, and e≈øtates; but ≈øo did not I, becau≈øe of the fear of God; no great advantages will make a man that fears God, to do as others do; he ≈øaith alwaies, others do ≈øo and ≈øo, but ≈øo will not I, becau≈øe I fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A man that fears God cannot do as others can do, in the matter wherein he is intru≈øted. You know how it was
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57690:49"/>with the Spyes, <hi>Caleb</hi> brought a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becau≈øe he feared God; but ≈øo did not the others.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, They that fear the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do as others do, in the matter of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. A man that fears the Lord, can love God in adver≈øitie, and fear him in pro≈øperity. It is ≈øaid of King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that he ≈øinned more and more, becau≈øe of his afflictions: but <hi>Jeho≈øophat</hi> did not ≈øo, when he was under great afflictions, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for he ≈øought to the Lord, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured after faith, and ≈øtrength from him, that ≈øo he might be e≈øtabli≈øhed: but ≈øo doth not the wicked man, becau≈øe he feareth not God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, As there is a great difference between a good man, and a wicked man, or between one that fears the Lord, and one that doth not in the matter of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: So there is a difference al≈øo in the matter of their refre≈øhment, in their eating, and drinking, and recreation. Job. 1.5. <hi>And it was ≈øo, when the dayes of their fea≈øting were gone about, that</hi> Job <hi>≈øent and ≈øanctified them. Job</hi> ≈øanctified them, and ≈øo cannot a wicked man do; but a man that fears the Lord can do this. And,</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, A man that truly fears the Lord,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57690:49"/>cannot do as others do, in the matter of right and propriety: they that fear not God, will take advantage upon others, in the matter of their right and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. You may ≈øee what <hi>Abraham</hi> did; <hi>Lot</hi> would not let <hi>Abraham</hi> have his right, though it was his right; yet <hi>Abraham</hi> becau≈øe he feared God, and for peace ≈øake, gives up his right; but tho≈øe that fear not the Lord cannot do ≈øo. Thus you ≈øee, that tho≈øe that truly fear God cannot, will not do as others do, in the matter of his choice, of his wor≈øhip, of his calling, of his afflictions, of his refre≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or of his right and propriety. And that is the ≈øecond general. But.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What is there in this fear of God, that ≈øhould ballance the ≈øoul, and cau≈øe it not to do as others do? Why,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, By the fear of God a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to depart from evil, as the P≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øt ≈øaith, There are two ≈øeeds in the world, the ≈øeed of the woman, and the ≈øeed of the ≈øerpent: now the≈øe two ≈øeeds rule in the whole world; in ≈øome the ≈øeed of the woman rules, and in ≈øome the ≈øeed of the ≈øerpent: now they that are of the ≈øeed of the woman can fear the Lord, but they that are of the ≈øeed of the ≈øerpent cannot fear the Lord; and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57690:50"/>therefore no wonder that they that fear the Lord cannot, will not do as others do; why, it is becau≈øe they are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øeed, they are of the ≈øeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As they that fear the Lord are of another ≈øeed, ≈øo they are al≈øo of another Principle, and therefore they cannot do as others do. Principles are the ≈øprings of all actions, and every man acts according to his principle, according to the principle that is in him. Now he that fears the Lord, differs from another man in his principles, and ≈øo he doth al≈øo in his actions, and in his ends.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Look into his ends, and you ≈øhall ≈øee how they differ from other mens; ends are the ≈øeeds of actions; and if ≈øo, a man that fears the Lord, his ends differ from other mens; and then no wonder that he cannot, will not do as others do. Again,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As he differs in his ends, ≈øo al≈øo in his con≈øcience; every man is according as his con≈øcience is: Take a man that fears the Lord, and he is tender of his con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but others that have their con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces burnt and ≈øeared, are not ≈øo, and if ≈øo, then no wonder that he that fears the Lord cannot, will not do as others do.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:57690:50"/>
            <p>Fifthly, As he that fears the Lord dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the the matter of his con≈øcience, ≈øo he differs al≈øo in the matter of his re≈øtraints. A wicked man ab≈øtains it may be from one evil, to commit another, but he that fears the Lord, ab≈øtains from all evil, becau≈øe of the fear of God, which the other doth not. A wicked man is bad in good company, and a good man is good in bad company, yea he is the ≈øame in all company; therefore he that fears the Lord cannot, will not do as others do. But,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is it po≈ø≈øible for a man that fears the Lord, to do ≈øometimes as others do?</p>
            <p>Yes he may: For the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks plainly concerning the ≈øame, Rom. 12.1. Mark what he ≈øaith; <hi>I be≈øeech you brethren by the mercies of God, That ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to this pre≈øent world,</hi> &amp;c. But now ob≈øerve this; That it is one thing what a man doth in a ≈øudden pa≈ø≈øion, and another thing what he doth in his ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious con≈øideration: For take a man that fears the Lord, and in his ≈øudden pa≈ø≈øion he ≈øhall deny Chri≈øt as well as another; but in the way of ≈øerious con≈øideration he ≈øhall never do it. And further take notice, that it is one thing what a man doth in a particular action, and another
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57690:51"/>thing what he doth in his common practice, for you may find in Scripture, that Gods people have ≈øometimes run away from God as to a particular Action, but yet in their con≈øtant cour≈øe they feared the Lord, and therefore tho≈øe that fear the Lord do not do as others do, becau≈øe if they turn a≈øide, they repent of their ≈øo doing, and turn to God again: So I ≈øay there is ≈øtill a difference between them that fear the Lord, &amp; tho≈øe that do not. But</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Suppo≈øe a man do truly fear the Lord, what is the I≈ø≈øue and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof? why the I≈ø≈øue will be this: If you fear the Lord, God will deal well with you, he will deal well with you in a ≈øpecial manner: he will make a difference between you &amp; another in his di≈øpen≈øations. P≈øal. 1. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man that walketh not in the coun≈øel of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, nor ≈øtandeth in the way of Sinners, nor ≈øetteth in the heat of the ≈øcornful; But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night; he ≈øhall be like a tree planted by the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that bringeth forth its fruit in his ≈øea≈øon, his lea≈øe al≈øo ≈øhall not wither, but what≈øoever he doth ≈øhall pro≈øper; the ungodly are not ≈øo, but are like unto the chaff, which the wind driveth away. Therefore the ungodly ≈øhall not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57690:51"/>≈øtand in Judgement, nor Sinners in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Righteous; But the way of the ungodly ≈øhall peri≈øh.</hi> Thus you ≈øee how Gods di≈øpen≈øations ≈øhall be to them that fear him: it ≈øhall go well with them, but not ≈øo to the wicked: It is ≈øaid that <hi>tho≈øe that feared the Lord ≈øpake often one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And it is ≈øaid in I≈øa. 8.11, 12. <hi>For the Lord ≈øpake thus to me with a ≈øtrong hand, and In≈øtructed me, not to walk in the way of this people, &amp;c.</hi> P≈øal. 112.6, 7, 8. You may find there that there will be a great difference one day, between them that fear the Lord, and they that do not: <hi>Surely he ≈øhall not be moved for ever, the Righteous ≈øhall be in everla≈øting remembrance. He ≈øhall not be afraid of evil Tydings, his heart is fixed tru≈øting in the Lord: his heart is e≈øtabli≈øhed, he ≈øhall not be afraid, untill he ≈øee his de≈øire upon his enemies, he hath di≈øper≈øed, he hath given to the poor, his Righteou≈øne≈øs indureth for ever, his horn ≈øhall be exalted with honour: The wicked ≈øhall ≈øee it and be grieved, he ≈øhall gna≈øh his teeth and melt away, the de≈øire of the wicked ≈øhall peri≈øh, yea God will do great things for them that fear him: he will put his law into their Hearts, that thereby they may keep his Commandments.</hi> He will do greatly for them, for his eye ≈øhall be upon them. The eye of the Lord
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57690:52"/>is upon the righteous, and his ear is open to their cry. He is ready to an≈øwer tho≈øe that fear him upon all accounts. Read what the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øaith, P≈øal. 31.19. <hi>O how great is thy goodne≈øs, which thou ha≈øt laid up for them that fear thee, that thou ha≈øt wrought for them that tru≈øt in thee, before the Sons of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea further if you truly fear the Lord, The eye of God ≈øhall be upon you for good; unto him will I look that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, unto him will I look that feareth ≈øaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>Again, if you truly fear the Lord, the Lord will delight in you,</p>
            <p>Yea God will be a God unto you, God will be a ≈øtrong Tower to you, and he will ≈øanctify all unto you: and to ≈øay no more, They that fear the Lord ≈øhall want no good thing: O what a ble≈ø≈øed thing is it then, to fear the Lord; for from him God will with-hold no good thing: and thus you ≈øee the I≈ø≈øue of this fearing of God; Con≈øider it, con≈øider I ≈øay the con≈øequence and I≈ø≈øue of it, and let it be ≈øo many motives to ≈øtir you up more and more to fear the Lord.</p>
            <p>So much ≈øhall ≈øerve for the Doctrinal part: Now then by way of Application,</p>
            <p>Here we may ≈øee what a ≈øad excu≈øe that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57690:52"/>will be which many make, That ≈øay they do but as others do, but Alas this is an excu≈øe fit for the lips of tho≈øe only, who fear not God at all. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, If this Doctrine be true, then here you may ≈øee who tho≈øe are that fear God in truth; there are many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to it; but we find here, that tho≈øe that truly fear the Lord cannot, will not do as others do: They will not do as others do in the matter of their choice, in the matter of their wor≈øhip, nor of their calling, nor in what they are intru≈øted with, nor in their refre≈øhments, nor in their Afflictions, nor in their right and propriety, and if it be ≈øo, how few are there that fear the Lord in Truth. They that truly fear God ≈øay always as <hi>Nehemiah, But ≈øo did not I becau≈øe of the fear of God.</hi> There are many that lie quiet under ≈øins of Omi≈ø≈øion, and under ≈øins of Commi≈ø≈øion too, but ≈øo will not I becau≈øe of the fear of God: Do others ≈øin, and do others act contrary to the will of God, yet let us not do ≈øo, but let us ≈øay with Nehemiah, But ≈øo will not I becau≈øe of the fear of God. O therefore let me de≈øire all to fear the Lord, And for you that do fear the Lord, be you comforted, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort belongs to you; Everla≈øting mercy
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57690:53"/>belongs to you who fear the Lord; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved you with an Everla≈øting love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be ≈øome will ≈øay, I am afraid I do not fear the Lord, and ≈øo this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth not belong to me; why con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Do you make con≈øcience of what you do, doth your con≈øcience accu≈øe you or not for what you do, do you find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience accu≈øe, or excu≈øe?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Have you not ≈øinned in the dark, when none could accu≈øe but God only, and do you Act, and walk, and live, and labour, as if you were in the pre≈øence and ≈øight of God? if you do thus, then you do fear the Lord, <hi>And then it ≈øhall be well with you, Eccle≈ø.</hi> 8.12. Again</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do you run, and ≈øpeak one to another, if ≈øo, then this is to fear the Lord, for it is ≈øaid that <hi>they that feared the Lord ≈øpake often one to another,</hi> Mal. 3.16. And</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Do you truly de≈øire to fear the Lord, then look into Nehemiah, and ob≈øerve his ≈øpirit well and do according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And to ≈øay no more,</p>
            <p>Have you had advantages to make you rich in this world, and would you not take them, becau≈øe of the fear of God,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57690:53"/>then certainly you have received free grace, and you have the Spirit of God, for this is a true ≈øign, that you have true grace in your hearts; and that you are one of them that truly fear the Lord: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be you comforted, for comfort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs unto you, everla≈øting mercy belongs unto you.</p>
            <p>But it may be ≈øome will ≈øay: Suppo≈øe I do not fear the Lord, what ≈øhall I do that I may fear the Lord, fear him as I ≈øhould do, fear him more and more.</p>
            <p>For an≈øwer, If you would fear the Lord in truth. Then</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Be humbled for want of this fear: That man is not far from grace, who is humbled for the want of grace; a man will never be humbled for unbelief; unle≈øs he be humbled for the want of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Go to God and beg of him to fulfil his promi≈øe, God hath ≈øaid, <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts;</hi> Now go to God I ≈øay and beg, and de≈øire him that he would make good this promi≈øe to you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would fear God in truth, then ob≈øerve what that is, that is neere≈øt, and deare≈øt to you, and give that up to God. You know <hi>Abraham</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> his only <hi>Son,</hi> and ≈øaith God,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57690:54"/>
               <hi>By this I know thou feare≈øt me.</hi> And further</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you would fear the Lord in Truth, then wor≈øhip God, according to his own appointment, take heed of mingling of Gods wor≈øhip with any of mans Inventions, for he that doth ≈øo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God, nor wor≈øhippeth him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own appointment. And then</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would fear the Lord in Truth, then take heed of ≈øinning when you have an opportunity, Again</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would fear God more, than love the Lord more, labour to ≈øtrengthen your love to God. Again</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If you would have your fear ≈øtrengthned more, and more, then ≈øtudy much the free grace of God, in giving out his mercy to one, more than to another, <hi>Two in a field, the one taken and the other left, Two walking together, the one taken, and the other left,</hi> If you would ≈øtrengthen your fear, ≈øtudy much the free grace of God.</p>
            <p>Eightly, If you would fear the Lord in Truth, Live much in, and ≈øtudy much upon, dependance wholly upon God, it is our great duty to depend upon God.</p>
            <p>If a man be upon a high Tower, and another holds him from falling by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57690:54"/>hand only, he will certainly be very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of offending him that holds him ≈øo: why we are thus in the hand of God, and our dependance is upon him for every thing, how fearful ought we then to be of offending this God, O ≈øtudy your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God more and more; and</p>
            <p>Again, U≈øe the world as u≈øing it not: deal with men as in the pre≈øence of God, and when you are dealing with men, be ≈øure to deal with God before all the men of the world.</p>
            <p>Again, Let your eye be very much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Severity and Ju≈øtice of God, upon his ≈øeverity and Ju≈øtice, con≈øider Gods ≈øeverene≈øs to <hi>Adam</hi> in eating the forbidden fruit, and his ≈øeverene≈øs to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> for a word, that for one word God would not let him enter into the promi≈øed land, and con≈øider his ≈øeverity to <hi>David</hi> for numbring the people. Yea</p>
            <p>Again con≈øider, That God cannot only de≈øtroy the body, but ≈øoul and body too. Therefore O man fear him that can <hi>de≈øtroy both body and ≈øoul when he will in Hell fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus now if you would have your fear ≈øtrengthened, then ≈øtudy the≈øe things, con≈øider and meditate upon the≈øe things. But yet a little further</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:57690:55"/>
            <p>If you would ≈øtrengthen your fear of God more and more, then labour after more Communion with him now, in this world while you are here, we u≈øe to ≈øay <hi>Too much familiarity breeds contempt,</hi> but here it is not ≈øo, for by familiarity and communion with God, we ≈øhall have more ≈øweetne≈øs, and more delight in his wayes, more ≈øtrength in his ≈øervice, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in our afflictions: If you would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have the≈øe advantages, then labour to walk more clo≈øe with God, and to have more communion with him; labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ≈øay to have more communion with God, if you would fear him more and more: The greater a per≈øon is here on Earth (as I told you before) the more we fear him, and the nearer he is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us, the more we reverence him.</p>
            <p>My Friends, would you obtain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting mercy, would you have everla≈øting mercy belong to you, then labour to fear the Lord in truth yet more and more, and I be≈øeech you to think of this Truth, meditate upon it, think of it upon all occa≈øions, and ≈øay, do others ≈ølubber over duties, ≈øo will not I, becau≈øe I fear the Lord; do others walk injuriou≈øly, ≈øo will not I, becau≈øe I fear the Lord; do
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57690:55"/>others do contrary to the will of God, but ≈øo will not I, becau≈øe I fear the Lord: Let this truth go up and down with you, and it will keep you in your dealing both with God and man: Remember the Charecter of one that fears the Lord, He is one that cannot, will not do as others do, for ≈øo ≈øaith the Text: <hi>But ≈øo did not I, becau≈øe of the fear of God.</hi>

            <p>IN this ≈øhort P≈øalm, we may ≈øee the excellency of the Saints Communion, fellow≈øhip, and Brotherly Agreement.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>De≈øcribed</hi> and <hi>Commended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, De≈øcribed from the fountain of it, from God as a Father, and therefore he ≈øayes, <hi>How good and how plea≈øant it is for Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, De≈øcribed al≈øo from the Act and Exerci≈øe thereof, <hi>which is to dwell together in <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is commended, from the goodne≈øs, and profitablene≈øs, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øantne≈øs of it, It is a good thing, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable thing for brethren to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Unity, behold how good it is in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57690:56"/>the eyes of men, behold how plea≈øant it is beyond expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>for brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the goodne≈øs and plea≈øantne≈øs of it is expre≈øt by two ≈øimilitudes: It is compared to the precious Oyntment upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> ver≈øe 2. <hi>It is like the precious Oyntment upon the head, that run down upon the beard; even</hi> Aarons <hi>heard, that went down to the skirts of his garment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is compared al≈øo to the dew that fell upon Hermon, and the hills of Zion, ver≈øe 3. <hi>As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that de≈øcended upon the mountains of Zion, &amp;c.</hi> Thus you ≈øee the de≈øign of this P≈øalm, is to declare the goodne≈øs, and profitablene≈øs of Unity between bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, from whence then I take up this Ob≈øervation;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a loving agreement between the Saints, among them≈øelves is exceeding plea≈øant, and very profitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some things are plea≈øant, but not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and ≈øome things are profitable and not Plea≈øant, as Phy≈øick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellow≈øhip and a loving agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Saints is both plea≈øant and profitable.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is a plea≈øant thing for the Saints, and people of God to agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57690:57"/>for the ≈øame word which is u≈øed here for <hi>plea≈øant,</hi> is u≈øed al≈øo in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew for a Harmony of Mu≈øick, ≈øuch as when they ri≈øe to the highe≈øt ≈øtrains of the Violl, when the ≈øtrings are all put in order, to make up a Harmony, ≈øo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant is it, ≈øuch plea≈øantne≈øs is there in the Saints Agreement.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame word is u≈øed al≈øo in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew for the plea≈øantne≈øs of a corn-field, when a field is clothed with corn, though it be cut down, yet it is very plea≈øant, O how plea≈øant is it, and ≈øuch is the Saints agreement.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame word in the P≈øalmi≈øt is u≈øed al≈øo for the ≈øweetne≈øs of honey, and of ≈øweet things, in oppo≈øition to bitter things; And thus you ≈øee the plea≈øantne≈øs of it, by its being compared to the Harmony of Mu≈øick, to the corn-field, to the ≈øweetne≈øs of honey, to the precious Oyntment that ran down <hi>Aarons</hi> beard, and to the dew that fell upon Hermon and the Hills of Zion: and all this is to di≈øcover the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øantne≈øs, profitablene≈øs, and ≈øweetne≈øs of the Saints Agreement. <hi>Behold how good and how plea≈øant it is, &amp;c.</hi> It is a plea≈øant thing to behold the Sun, but it is much more plea≈øant to behold the Saints Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Unity among them≈øelves.</p>
            <pb n="107" facs="tcp:57690:57"/>
            <p>There are many times breakings and lo≈øings in the love of the Saints, and therefore when they come to an agreement and union among them≈øelves again, it mu≈øt needs be very plea≈øant and profitable, and ≈øweet, for things once lo≈øt and found again are very ≈øweet; And upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that the Commandment of love is called <hi>a new Commandment,</hi> becau≈øe it is broken ≈øo often, and ≈øo often renewed again: And the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øpeaks here of the ≈øweetne≈øs and plea≈øantne≈øs of Unity, becau≈øe there is no ≈øweetne≈øs in divi≈øion, but Unity is a good way and means to keep out trouble, and evil divi≈øion from among a people. And</p>
            <p>Further, the more difficulty any mercy is obtained with, the ≈øweeter it is when obtained; there are many things which are hard to come by, but when they are obtained they are ≈øweet, and ≈øo there are many difficulties in the way of love and ≈øweet agreement, and the people of God are incumbred with many difficulties, they have many things to put them out of the way of love, and of ≈øweet agreement among them≈øelves; and therefore ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle Phil. 1.27. <hi>Only let your Conver≈øation be as becometh the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, that whether I come and ≈øee you, or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57690:58"/>el≈øe be ab≈øent, I may hear of your affairs, that you ≈øtand fa≈øt in one Spirit, with one mind ≈øtriving together for the faith of the Go≈øpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The more ≈øuitable any thing is to our condition, the more plea≈øant and ≈øweet it is: Now this brotherly love and union, is a conjunction of ≈øuitable things, and is ≈øuitable to our condition, and ≈øuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things are delightful unto men, and the more ≈øuitable any thing is, the more we delight in it: And this agreement, this union, is every way ≈øuitable to our own condition as we are <hi>men,</hi> and is al≈øo ≈øuitable to all the creatures, for they run together, and agree together; And it is ≈øuitable to us al≈øo as we are <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> it is ≈øuitable to Chri≈øts command; <hi>A new command ≈øaith he. I give unto you, that you love one another.</hi> It is ≈øuitable to Chri≈øts own example, who hath loved us; and ≈øuitable al≈øo to the Go≈øpel, which is a Go≈øpel of peace: <hi>Let your conver≈øation be as becometh the Go≈øpel, that you be of one ≈øpirit, and of one mind:</hi> So I ≈øay, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreement is every way ≈øuitable, and therefore the more plea≈øant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ≈øo it ought to be unto us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it is plea≈øant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ≈øo it is a profitable good: <hi>Behold how good a thing it is,</hi> it is very profitable.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57690:58"/>For is it not profitable for the <hi>dew to fall upon</hi> Hermon, <hi>and upon the hills of</hi> Zion, <hi>to make them fruitfull?</hi> Why, ≈øuch is the dew of holy agreement, when it falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of men: And this doth make men increa≈øe, and multiply in the Church, and to be fruitful in good works; the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>God commandeth his ble≈ø≈øing;</hi> and when God ble≈ø≈øeth, we ≈øhall certainly increa≈øe and multiply; and this I ≈øay did increa≈øe the Church, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are the Saints both increa≈øed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted by the ble≈ø≈øing of God on them, they do increa≈øe in things that are good, and profitable; and this was the thing which Chri≈øt prayed for, yea prayed for again and again; yea as I ≈øaid it is the great thing which Chri≈øt hath commanded: <hi>A new command,</hi> &amp;c. Is it not therefore good and profitable to love one another?</p>
            <p>Again, This is the mercy and the grace that is promi≈øed, ≈øpecially in the latter times glorious things are ≈øpoken of, and promi≈øed to the la≈øt daies; and this is one of tho≈øe things which are promi≈øed, and if ≈øo, it is then certainly good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.</p>
            <p>Again, This is the Legacy which Chri≈øt left with his di≈øciples and people; ≈øaith he, <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57690:59"/>unto you, not as the world giveth, give I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> John 14.27. and therefore ≈øurely this agreement among brethren is very good and profitable.</p>
            <p>Again, Certainly it is good, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to walk worthy of the high calling, to which Chri≈øt hath called us, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, Eph. 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>I be≈øeech you to walk worthy of the vocation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye are called, with all lowline≈øs and meekne≈øs, with long ≈øuffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the ≈øpirit in the bond of peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it not good and profitable that our prayers ≈øhould be heard, that God ≈øhould hear and grant our reque≈øts and prayers? Why, look into the Scriptures, and you will find that our love is a help to our prayers; it is a help unto us, whereby to have our prayers heard and an≈øwered.</p>
            <p>Again, Is it not good and profitable for a man to know that he is a child of God, and that he hath an intere≈øt in Chri≈øt? Why, look into 1 John 3.14. <hi>We know that we have pa≈ø≈øed from death unto life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe we love the brethren:</hi> There is a day of death, of natural death, whereby man ≈øhall pa≈øs from life to death; and there is likewi≈øe a time of ≈øpiritual life; when a man pa≈ø≈øeth from death to life. Now
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57690:59"/>how ≈øhall I know whether I am <hi>pa≈ø≈øed from death to life? Why, if I love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Yea ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Hereby ≈øhall all know that you are my di≈øciples, if you love one another;</hi> not only your ≈øelves ≈øhall know it, but others ≈øhall know it al≈øo; and is it not then very good, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? For hereby you ≈øhall know that your prayers are heard; and by this al≈øo you ≈øhall know that you are pa≈ø≈øed from death to life; and hereby you ≈øhall not only know your ≈øelves to be Chri≈øts di≈øciples, but others ≈øhall know it al≈øo: and if it be ≈øo, then certainly it mu≈øt be good and profitable.</p>
            <p>Again, This will give a reli≈øh and a ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to all your injoyments; it is the ≈øalt of all your comforts: <hi>Have ≈øalt in your ≈øelves, and have peace one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although our condition be never ≈øo pro≈øperous, yet if we cannot agree among our ≈øelves, if love and peace be wanting, that ≈øowrs all the re≈øt; and though the ordinances be never ≈øo ≈øweet, and our priviledges never ≈øo many, yet if we be not united together in love, all is made ≈øowre; this is that which ≈øowrs all our enjoyments, the want of love, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that gives a reli≈øh to all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments when we have it.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:57690:60"/>
            <p>Again, This is that which will make all things ea≈øie unto you, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo hard in them≈øelves; whereas the contrary will make all things hard though never ≈øo ea≈øie: If I am to do a work or a ≈øervice for one: why, though the work be never ≈øo hard of it ≈øelf, yet love will make it ea≈øie; many complain and ≈øay they cannot profit by the Ordinances: why, what is the rea≈øon? It is for want of love to them; there are jarrs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between friend and friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this man and the other man; why, it is for want of love: Love would make all things ea≈øie for you, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo hard. Now put all the≈øe things together, and then you may ≈øee, what a plea≈øant and profitable thing it is, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to dwell together in unity, to love, to unite, to live in unity one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Well then if this be ≈øo, why ≈øhould we not all abound in it? why do not we love and agree one with another, if it be ≈øo good and profitable as we have heard, then let us all agree together.</p>
            <p>But it may be ≈øome will ≈øay, we do live together in love and unity, and we are united one to another, But</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Yet give me leave to mind you
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57690:60"/>of what the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, 1 The≈ø≈ø. 4.9. <hi>But as touching brotherly love, you need not that I write unto you; for you your ≈øelves are taught of God to love one another, and indeed ye do it towards all the brethren which are in all</hi> Macedonia; <hi>but we be≈øeech you brethren that you increa≈øe more and more.</hi> Though you do it, yet we be≈øeech you to increa≈øe it more and more, and ≈øo I ≈øay to you: yea and Chri≈øt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it al≈øo, and you mu≈øt do it in obedience to his command.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If our love be right as it ≈øhould be, then we ≈øhall love others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo, even our neighbours and friends and brethren; we ≈øhall love them as our ≈øelves. <hi>The ≈øecond Commandment</hi> ≈øaith our Saviour, <hi>is like unto it, that you love your neighbour as your ≈øelf.</hi> Pray for your ≈øelves, do all the good you can for your ≈øelves, avoid all iniquity that may come upon your ≈øelves, and to prove your love to be right, do all this for your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours al≈øo, and love them as your ≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If our love be as it ≈øhould be, we ≈øhall then love others, becau≈øe they are godly, let them be of this opinion, or of the other opinion, yet that matters not; though they be not of my opinion, yet if my love be right, I love them becau≈øe they are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57690:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>and I love him mo≈øt that is mo≈øt godly; and as his increa≈øeth godline≈øs, ≈øo mu≈øt my love increa≈øe toward him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If your love be true, and ≈øuch as it ought to be, then you will love one another, and love your brother; as Chri≈øt loved you, even ≈øo ought you to love one another; how was that? why, Chri≈øt loved you freely, in oppo≈øition to all the injuries you had done unto him: It is ≈øaid, 1 Joh. 1.6, 7. <hi>If we ≈øay we have fellow≈øhip with him, and walk in darkne≈øs, we lie and do not the truth; but if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip one with another:</hi> and in John 3.16. <hi>For God ≈øo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ≈øon.</hi> Yea Chri≈øt hath ≈øo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, that he hath laid down his life for us; and we are to love as Chri≈øt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, even to the laying down of our lives for our brethren.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If your love be true, it ought to be without re≈øtriction, yea and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all di≈ø≈øimulation: I ≈øay you are to love without any re≈øtriction, the only mea≈øure of love is to know no mea≈øure; and you are to love without any di≈ø≈øimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, yea and your love ought to be al≈øo without degeneration; many do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to love ≈øpiritually, but end carnally;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57690:61"/>but true love is without re≈øtriction, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øimulation, or degeneration.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If your love be true, and ≈øuch as it ought to be, then it will never be bought, neither can it be ≈øold; Love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bought, and if it be true love, it will never be ≈øold, neither directly nor indirectly.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If your love be as it ought to be, it will be ≈øingular, it will make you ≈øingular in your love: <hi>Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ≈øaith Chri≈øt; It hath been ≈øaid you ≈øhall hate your enemies, and love your neighbours,</hi> but I ≈øay unto you love them both, <hi>love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and de≈øpightfully u≈øe you; for if you love them that love you what reward have you, do not even the Publicans ≈øo,</hi> Mat. 5.43, 44, 45. Love them that hate you, this is ≈øingular love; and love where it is true, will make a man thus ≈øingular in his ways and carriage.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, True love is a praying love. Saies one, <hi>I never loved any man, till I had prayed for him in particular:</hi> true love I ≈øay is a praying love.</p>
            <p>And true love is a love at all times, at one time as well as another.</p>
            <p>And a man that loves truly, declares that he is loo≈øned from the world, and that he is one that is wrought upon by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57690:62"/>the Holy Gho≈øt: In the Primitive times, it was ≈øaid that they were all of one heart, and all things were common among them; and when we are thus of one heart and of one mind; it doth declare that we have been wrought upon by the Holy Gho≈øt; and therefore certainly, there is a great mi≈øtake in mens love, all men ≈øay they love the ≈øaints; they love them in words, though I am afraid many love them but little in their hearts.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, how far is our love to be exerci≈øed, <hi>upon whom,</hi> and <hi>how farr?</hi> I ≈øay no more but this, ≈øo far as the word <hi>Brethren</hi> doth extend, ≈øo far this union and love ought to go, <hi>Behold how good and how plea≈øant it is for Brethren to dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in unity.</hi> So far I ≈øay, as this word brethren extends; and that is ≈øo far, as God is their Father, it matters not for opinion, or what judgement they are of; if God be their Father, they are your brethren, and are to be beloved by you, and ≈øo far is your love to reach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay wherein doth this love con≈øi≈øt?</p>
            <p>Why, in the≈øe three things.</p>
            <p>In the matter of our judgements.</p>
            <p>In the matter of our Affections.</p>

            <p>In the matter of our Practice.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In the matter of our <hi>Judgements.</hi> Rom. 12.16. <hi>Be of the ≈øame mind one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, mind not high things, but condi≈øcend to men of low e≈øtate; Be not wi≈øe in your own conceit, recompence no man evil for evil; if it be po≈ø≈øible as much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In the matter of our <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in the 10. ver≈øe of this Chapter. <hi>Be kindly affectioned one towards another with brotherly love, in honour preferring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the matter of our <hi>Practice, read the</hi> 3. <hi>ver≈øe of this Chapter, For I ≈øay through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf more highly than he ought to think; but to think ≈øoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the mea≈øure of faith.</hi> Thus you ≈øee how we ≈øhould act, as to our Judgements, Affections, and Practices, one toward another.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay if this be ≈øo, then how much is our love wanting one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, but what ≈øhall we do, that our love to one another may be more knit together; what ≈øhall we do that we may advance, and ri≈øe to this holy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in our own hearts and others?</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57690:63"/>
            <p>For an≈øwer hereunto, take the≈øe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Be ≈øerious in this work, and lay a≈øide the former hinderances of your love, and your former divi≈øions; and let not any of you ≈øay, this is the fault, and that is the fault, and ≈øuch a one is the cau≈øe of it, and ≈øuch a one is the occa≈øion of it: No, but lay the ≈øault on your ≈øelves, lay it upon your ≈øelves, and not upon others, and ≈øay, <hi>It is I, the Lord knows it is I; it is I that have rai≈øed this ≈øtorm; and ≈øay as</hi> David, <hi>I have ≈øinned, I have ≈øinned.</hi> Let not your former divi≈øions be forgotten, but take warning by them; lay not the fault I ≈øay upon others, but upon your ≈øelves, and acknowledge it and ≈øay; It is I, I Lord that have ≈øinned. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you do de≈øire to be ≈øerious in this work, then do you de≈øire Peace; and if it be po≈ø≈øible live at peace with all men: the ≈øame word that is u≈øed in the original for Per≈øecutors, is al≈øo u≈øed for peace, to ≈øhew that we ≈øhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after it with might and main, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecutors follow tho≈øe they per≈øecute; and that if po≈ø≈øible we ≈øhould live at peace with all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be ≈øure you ≈øtrengthen your love; Love mu≈øt be ≈øtrengthned, el≈øe this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57690:63"/>union cannot continue; it is the property of love to interpret love in the be≈øt ≈øence, to interpret things well.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is the property of love to ≈øpeak highly of the per≈øon, or thing belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; where there is an uniting, and a ≈øweet agreement, there love will ≈øpeak high things of each other.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The property of love is to cover the infirmities of tho≈øe they love; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how can there be any agreement, if infirmities be not covered: It is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of love to give no offence, nor to take any; and it is a great ≈øign that there is no agreement, nor no love, when people are ≈øo apt to give offence, and to take offence; for true love is apt to do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to take all in good part.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, True love knows how to give and how to take admonitions: And thus you have heard what love will do; therefore I be≈øeech you to ≈øtrengthen your love to one another; yea I be≈øeech you in the Lord to increa≈øe it more and more, one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another.</p>
            <p>But you may ≈øay further, ≈øuppo≈øe there be a difference in the matter of our Judgements or opinions: what ≈øhall we do to remove it? Why,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Be ≈øure of this, that you do not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57690:64"/>mi≈øtake the meaning of that Scripture, which your judgement is founded upon. It is ≈øaid <hi>There was a divi≈øion among the people becau≈øe of Chri≈øt;</hi> why for what was it, what was the rea≈øon of it? It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of mi≈øunder≈øtanding, and for want of a right under≈øtanding of Chri≈øt: So I ≈øay, this divi≈øion may come for want of a right under≈øtanding of the Scriptures, upon which our judgement is grounded and founded. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider O man whether you do not ≈øettle your judgement upon the judgement, or opinion of any, or upon the knowledge of another: <hi>Ha≈øt thou faith ≈øaith</hi> the Apo≈øtle, <hi>have it to thy ≈øelf before God;</hi> Rom. 14.22. But is not a man then to confe≈øs his faith before others, when he is called to it? Yes, But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle ≈øpeaks here of le≈ø≈øer things; if thou ha≈øt faith have it to thy ≈øelf in little di≈øputable things; and do not rely upon others, but look to thy ≈øelf, and give things a time; <hi>in due time God will reveal,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if you de≈øire this holy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then do what you can to keep uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Mini≈øtry, and between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry. It was not for nothing that our Saviour prayed, John 17.11, 21. <hi>Holy
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57690:64"/>Father keep through thine own name, tho≈øe whom thou ha≈øt given me, that they may be one as we are; That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they al≈øo may be one in us.</hi> It is not good for people to cry, <hi>I am for</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am for</hi> Apollo, <hi>and I am for</hi> Cephas, and the like, this is the way to make divi≈øion; therefore do all you can to live in love and unity; for love is of God, and the contrary is of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take heed of di≈øputation, what have we got this many years by di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation? tho≈øe that are weak, are ≈øooner brought in by humiliation, than by Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If after all this there do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main divi≈øion among you, by rea≈øon of your judgements, or opinions; then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Apo≈øtles rule, and be ≈øure to walk by it: for ≈øaith he (as we in≈øtanced before) <hi>Let no man think more highly of him≈øelf than he ought to think, but to think ≈øoberly; as God hath dealt to every man the mea≈øure of faith.</hi> The Apo≈øtle directs us, to live humbly, and walk meekly one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another; and not to be ra≈øh, or to think highly of our ≈øelves. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If we would live in love and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57690:65"/>unity, then let us look upon other mens infirmities in conjunction with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and their excellencies in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with their infirmities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the one will take away or hide the other: Let us not pore only upon a mans infirmities, upon his <hi>Euts</hi> as I may ≈øay; he is a godly man but ‚Äî: therefore if you would agree, joyn his infirmities and his excellencies together, and then look upon him.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If you ≈øhould meet with any provocation, that may weaken your love one toward another, then be ≈øure to take that as an opportunity to exerci≈øe your patience, and your love; when you meet a beggar in the ≈øtreets full of ≈øores, then you think you have an opportunity to exerci≈øe your charity, to give ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And ≈øo you ≈øhould ≈øay, when you are provoked by another to debilitate your love and affection, you may ≈øay, why now have I an opportunity to exerci≈øe my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Again</p>
            <p>Eighthly, If you will live in love and unity, then you mu≈øt re≈øolve, with the grace of God, to love, where you are not beloved; let love ri≈øe above all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; labour for a Go≈øpel ≈øpirit, to love though you are not loved: A Legal ≈øpirit
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57690:65"/>is a fretful ≈øpirit, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>you know not of what ≈øpirit you are of;</hi> labour I ≈øay after a Go≈øpel ≈øpirit, yea the ≈øpirit of Chri≈øt <hi>who was as a Lamb, he opened not his mouth:</hi> if you would live in love and unity, then take heed of a Legal ≈øpirit, and labour after this Go≈øpel ≈øpirit. Again</p>
            <p>Ninthly, If you would agree together, and live in love and unity; then be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the want of love to one another, and take heed for the future of tho≈øe things that hinder your love one toward another, there are four or five of them, ob≈øerve them and take heed of them.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>Pride,</hi> A proud man is much gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to contention.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Pa≈ø≈øion,</hi> For though a man di≈ølikes, and is ≈øorry for what he hath done in his pa≈ø≈øion, when it is over, and though what he doth in his pa≈ø≈øion be one thing, and what he doth in his ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous con≈øideration is another thing; yet we are to take great heed of pa≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another enemy to love is <hi>≈øtrangene≈øs,</hi> ≈øtrangene≈øs ends in enmity; when brethren and friends grow ≈øtrangers one to another, then they ≈øurmi≈øe things one of another; and that de≈øtroys love and unity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another is <hi>de≈øigning one again≈øt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57690:66"/>another;</hi> true love knows no de≈øigns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others; no man can endure to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns laid again≈øt him; de≈øigning cau≈øeth anger, enmity and hatred, and hinders true love one toward another.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another is <hi>whi≈øpering, a whi≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ≈øeparateth true friends,</hi> Pro. 16.28. But now if any one ≈øhould come to me, and tell me any thing again≈øt a brother, I would not believe the whi≈øperer, till I had ≈øpoken with the other; for a cau≈øe can never be truly known, nor judged of, till both parties have been heard ≈øpeak: Thus you may ≈øee the five things that hinder love, that is Pride, Pa≈ø≈øion, Strangene≈øs, de≈øigning one upon another, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto whi≈øperers. Now as you de≈øire to live in love and unity, ob≈øerve the≈øe things, and take heed of them.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Let me ≈øay to you (holy and beloved brethren) if you would love one another, then forgive one another, and live more unto God who loveth you, live more to God, le≈øt he ≈øhould turn his love to hatred and wrath again≈øt you.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Strengthen your love to God him≈øelf, the more love you have to God, the more will you love others.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If you would live in love and Unity, then you mu≈øt willingly take wrong,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57690:66"/>and give up your right for peace ≈øake, and for agreement: ≈øaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Let there be no difference between my heardmen and thy heardmen, for we are brethren;</hi> Now <hi>Abraham</hi> was the elder, and therefore it was his right to have the choice, but yet for peace ≈øake he gives up his right, and ≈øayes to <hi>Lot, Take what you will, the right hand or the left:</hi> there was a divi≈øion between them, and the Cananites were in the land, and therefore it was no good time for them to be at difference one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: when the Cananites were in the land, it was no good time then for good men to ≈øtrive, and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> for peace ≈øake gives up his right: ≈øo I ≈øay for peace ≈øake and for a holy agreement, you ≈øhould willingly give up your right, and render up your own right to pre≈øerve peace and Unity one with another; O friends, love one another that you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare your ≈øelves to be heavenly children, to be children of your heavenly Father, con≈øider, Phil. 1.27. <hi>Only let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation be as becometh the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt; that whether I come or be ab≈øent, I may hear of your affairs, that you ≈øtand fa≈øt in one Spirit, with one mind ≈øtriving together for the faith of the Go≈øpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O friends, let me be≈øeech you to love
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57690:67"/>one another, and to take all advantages that may increa≈øe your love, how can you ≈øhew your face, before the free love and grace of God, if you do not love one another; with what face can you go to God for free grace and love, when you your ≈øelves have no love for your brethren.</p>
            <p>If a poor man ≈øhould do a rich man a great deal of prejudice, and if this rich man ≈øhould neverthele≈øs invite this poor man to a fea≈øt, and welcome him, and do him abundance of good, would you not ≈øay that this is wonderful love and kindne≈øs, becau≈øe the poor man is no way able to gratify him, or to make any requital for what he receives, but only by thankfulne≈øs; it may be he may be thankful to him: why thus it is with us now, this is our own ca≈øe, for we have done great injury to God, and yet God hath loved us, and hath given us ble≈ø≈øings and riches, and what doth he expect for it all, ≈øurely no reward from us, for he knows we are poor and not able to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him, no he expects nothing, but only that we ≈øhould love one another; ≈øaies God, you can do nothing for me, all that I de≈øire is, that you would love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Truth; How then, I ≈øay, will you be able to ≈øhew your faces before the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57690:67"/>God of heaven, if you love not one Another.</p>
            <p>O look after this love, which is ≈øo much commended in this little P≈øalm, O how ≈øweet, and perfuming it is, it is as ≈øweet as honey, <hi>is is like unto the Oyl that ran down</hi> Aarons <hi>beard, like the dew upon Hermon, and as the dew that fell down upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Zion;</hi> yea this is that which is ≈øweet and profitable, that which will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume you; now if you do de≈øire that Gods perfumes may come upon you, and that the dew of Gods ble≈ø≈øings may fall upon you, labour more and more to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and let not love be wanting; I cannot tell how it may be with you, yet let me de≈øire you, as you would honour your ≈øelves now, and as you de≈øire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs in this life, and al≈øo to be ble≈ø≈øed hereafter to all Eternity, ob≈øerve this <hi>new Commandment</hi> to love one another; and as you do de≈øire to declare that you have received free grace, and that you have that ≈øeal, with which God ≈øeals the ≈øoul for his own, to live with him for ever, be exhorted to be of one mind, and love one another, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, and be of one mind;</hi> be united one to another, and let your hearts abound in love more and more one toward another.</p>

                     <hi>MICAH. 6.9.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City, and the man of Wi≈ødom ≈øhall ≈øee thy name, hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it.</p>

            <p>MEthinks I ≈øee a great rod, ready to be layd upon the back of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I would therefore at this time endeavour to inform you what the voice of this Rod is, and have to that end cho≈øen this Scripture to ≈øpeak unto.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter then you have Gods controver≈øy with his own people; ≈øet down at the end of the 2. ver≈øe. <hi>For the Lord hath a controver≈øy with his people, and he will plead with I≈ørael;</hi> And then he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them with</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Unthankfulne≈øs for many years in the 3.4. &amp; 5. ver≈øes, <hi>O my people what have I done unto thee, and wherewith have
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57690:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>have I done unto thee, and wherewith have I wearied thee, te≈øtifie again≈øt me, for I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He Chargeth them with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and ≈øhews them the evill of it, in the 6. and 7. ver≈øes, <hi>Will the Lord be plea≈øed with thou≈øands of rams,</hi> &amp;c. And then</p>
            <p>Thirthly, He pleades again≈øt them in the 8. ver≈øe. <hi>He hath ≈øhewed thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju≈øtice and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And then</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He ≈øeals up the Sentence in this ver≈øe of my Text. <hi>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City, and the man of Wi≈ødom ≈øhall ≈øee thy name, hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein you have three things e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially remarkable.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The people the Lords voice cryeth unto, and that is unto the City, <hi>the Lords voice cryeth unto the City.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You have en exhortation to hear the voice of the Rod. <hi>Hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have an Argument to pre≈øs you ≈øo to do; <hi>It is your wi≈ødom, the man of wi≈ødom ≈øhall ≈øee thy name. The Lords voice cryeth unto the City,</hi> that is unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and Jeru≈øalem, the Chief Cities:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57690:69"/>
               <hi>And the man of wi≈ødom ≈øhall ≈øee thy name:</hi> The di≈øpen≈øations of God in the way of his mercy or Ju≈øtice are his <hi>name:</hi> As a man is known by his name, ≈øo God is known by his di≈øpen≈øations, which though they be dark to the world, yet the man of wi≈ødom ≈øhall ≈øee them and di≈øcern them: <hi>Therefore hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it</hi> the Rod; that is the Rod of Correction, Now there is</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Rod of power and dignity, <hi>He ≈øhall ≈øend his rod out of Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a rod of Di≈øcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: Ezek. 20.37. <hi>I will cau≈øe you to pa≈øs under the Rod, and I will bring you under the bond of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is the rod of direction: <hi>Thy rod and thy ≈øtaff they ≈øhall comfort me,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, There is a rod of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Eccle≈øia≈øtical and civil: As for Eccle≈øia≈øtical ≈øaith Paul, <hi>≈øhall I come unto you with a rod,</hi> and as for civil, <hi>he that ≈øpareth the rod hateth the Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is a rod of De≈øtruction, <hi>thou ≈øhalt break them with a Rod of Iron, and da≈øh them to peices like a potters ve≈ø≈øel, P≈øalm</hi> 2.9.</p>
            <p>Now it is a rod of Correction that we are to under≈øtand here, from whence I take up this Ob≈øervation.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:57690:69"/>
            <p>That when God vi≈øits the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his people with a rod, it is their be≈øt wi≈ødom to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it; It is their true Intere≈øt and be≈øt wi≈ødom ≈øo to do.</p>
            <p>For the opening and cleering hereof, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to the≈øe 4. or 5. Propo≈øitions.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That God doth not ≈øteal upon a people with his Judgements, but he fir≈øt warns them before he ≈ømites them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When God ≈ømites his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he deals with them in the way of rod.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That Gods Rod is a teaching Rod.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That the me≈ø≈øage of the Rod is commonly ≈øent to the great Cities, and to the great Towns of a Nation or people.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, when God ≈ømites his own people with the rod, it is their be≈øt wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and their duty to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Though God con≈øumes a Nation at once, and de≈øtroys a Nation at once at la≈øt; Yet he ≈øtill doth, and will, warn a people before he de≈øtroys them, God will not ≈øteal upon a people with his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but he fir≈øt warns them, before he con≈øumes them: he hath his murdering peices which he will di≈øcharg in due time, but he will fir≈øt di≈øcharg his warning
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57690:70"/>peices: And God doth ≈øometimes warn people by his word, and ≈øometime by his works and di≈øpen≈øations, Ezek. 33.2. <hi>Son of man ≈øpeak unto the Children of thy people and ≈øay unto them, if I bring a ≈øword upon the Land,</hi> &amp;c. And at the 7. ver≈øe he applies it. So ≈øaith he, <hi>Thou O Son of man I have ≈øet thee for a watchman, unto the hou≈øe of I≈ørael; therefore thou ≈øhall hear the word from my mouth, and warn them from me;</hi> would you know what this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, why it is a warning by the word,</p>
            <p>Sometimes God warns his people by his works and di≈øpen≈øations, by his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon others, and by his Afflictions upon them≈øelves, he brings a le≈ø≈øer Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prevent a greater; it is with the works of God as it with his word: Now God doth ≈øometimes hew down men by the word, yea he hews them down by the Mini≈øtry of the word; there is a time when God will hew down ≈øinners by the Mini≈øtry of the word, and lays them upon the ground a drying (as I may ≈øay) for Hell, before they come there; Matt. 3. <hi>The tree that bringeth not forth fruit, is hewn down and ca≈øt into the fire,</hi> Ho≈øea. 6.5. <hi>Therefore I have hewed them by the Prophets, I have ≈ølain them by the words of my mouth,</hi> &amp;c. There is a time of hewing down, a time
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57690:70"/>when God will hew men down by the mini≈øtry of the word, and as he doth thus by his word, ≈øo he doth the ≈øame al≈øo by his works and di≈øpen≈øations; and though God may, and can de≈øtroy a people at once, yet he will not ≈øie≈øe upon them before he warn them: that is the fir≈øt propro≈øition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When God ≈ømites his own people he deals with them in the way of the Rod, though he puni≈øh others with Scorpious, yet ≈øaith he, for you that are in Covenant with me, if you ≈øin <hi>I will vi≈øit your trangre≈ø≈øions with a Rod:</hi> look what worldly Afflictions come upon the Saints they are ≈øtruck with the Rod; what greater afflictions do you read of, than what fell upon <hi>Job,</hi> why yet it was the ≈øtroke of the Rod, Job 9.34. <hi>Let him take away his Rod from me;</hi> when God deals with his people I ≈øay, he deals with them in the way of the Rod, and if you a≈øk the rea≈øon, why God u≈øes the rod with his own people, I an≈øwer,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe they are his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Heb. 12.7, 8. <hi>If you indure cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øement God deals with you as with children, if you be without cha≈øti≈øement you are ba≈øtards and not Sons. I know no better Argument again≈øt the Church of Rome</hi> ≈øaith Luther, <hi>than this, that ≈øhe reigns without the Cro≈øs.</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:57690:71"/>If two children are fighting together, and a man comes and parts them, and ≈øtrikes one of them, and not the other, you will pre≈øently imagine that the Child which he ≈øtrikes is his own; and ≈øo if you ask why God u≈øeth the rod to his people, I an≈øwer, becau≈øe they are his own Children. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, As they are Children, ≈øo he loves them, and he that ≈øpareth the Rod hateth the Child: Now God doth not hate his Children, <hi>for every ≈øon that he loveth he cha≈øti≈øeth,</hi> God loves his children, and therefore he deals with them in the way of the Rod.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is <hi>much folly bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of Correction bringeth it out</hi> ≈øaith Solomon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God doth ≈øometimes correct his people becau≈øe of their folly.</p>
            <p>Why do School-Ma≈øters u≈øe the Rod but only to make children learn their le≈ø≈øons; if they would learn without, he would not u≈øe the Rod; and why doth God u≈øe the Rod with his people but to learn them their le≈ø≈øons; for the≈øe rea≈øons therefore doth God u≈øe the rod with his people.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay; doth not God u≈øe the Rod with the wicked too, do not they come under the rod as well as the righteous.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer: Solomon ≈øaith <hi>the Rod is for the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57690:71"/>back of the fool,</hi> and wicked men are called ≈øools in Scripture, God doth ≈øometimes cha≈øti≈øe the Godly by the wicked, the wicked are the rod in Gods hand, and ≈øometimes again, God doth puni≈øh wicked men by the Saints, the Saints being the rod in Gods hand: Sometimes I ≈øay wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are the rod for the Godly: <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 10.5. <hi>O A≈ø≈øyrian the rod of mine anger, and the ≈øtaff of their hand is mine indignation.</hi> And ≈øometimes the Godly, are the Rod of God, in the hand of God, for puni≈øhing the wicked, Jer. 51.19, 20. <hi>The portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things, and I≈ørael is the rod of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, the Lord of Ho≈øts is his name: Thou art my battle Axe and weapons of War, for with thee will I break in peices the Nations, and with thee will I de≈øtroy Kingdoms.</hi> So I ≈øay, as the Lord whips the ≈øaints by the wicked, ≈øo he al≈øo la≈øhes the wicked by the Godly, they being the rod in the hand of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, is there no difference between the≈øe two?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer yes, for 1. There is a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping rod, a rod of correction, and there is al≈øo a breaking rod; a whipping rod for the Saints, and a breaking rod for the wicked. In the 2. P≈øalm it is ≈øaid, <hi>Thou will rule them with a rod of Iron, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57690:72"/>break them in pieces like a potters ve≈ø≈øel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Though God doth Afflict his own people with the rod, the wicked being the rod in Gods hand, yet he will ca≈øt that rod into the ≈øire, when he hath done with it, but though he doth al≈øo puni≈øh the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of the wicked by the righteous, they being the rod in Gods hand, yet will he not ca≈øt that rod al≈øo into the fire upon that Account: the Saints may rejoyce when they ≈øee the wicked pun≈øhed, becau≈øe they know that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves ≈øhall not be thrown into the fire, but the wicked have no cau≈øe to rejoyce when they ≈øee the Godly afflicted, becau≈øe they may be ≈øure, they them≈øelves ≈øhall be thrown into the fire, when they have done their work; The Child may laugh when he ≈øees the rod thrown into the fire, becau≈øe he knows he ≈øhall not be thrown in him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though God doth vi≈øit the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his people with a Rod, yet it is a Rod that Cha≈øtizeth <hi>in mea≈øure,</hi> as you may find I≈øaiah 27.7, 8. <hi>Hath he ≈ømitten him, as he ≈ømote tho≈øe that ≈ømote him, or is he ≈ølain according to the ≈ølaughter of them that are ≈ølain by him? In mea≈øure when it ≈øhooteth forth thou wilt debate with it, he ≈øtayeth his rough wind, in the day of the Ea≈øt-wind: and ≈øo in P≈øalm</hi> 89.31, 32.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57690:72"/>
               <hi>If his Children for≈øake my Law, then will I vi≈øit their tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions with a rod, and their iniquity with ≈øtripes: And ≈øo</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. <hi>I will be his Father and he ≈øhall be my ≈øon, if he committ iniquity I will cha≈øti≈øe him with the rod of men, and with the ≈øtripes of the children of men;</hi> So I ≈øay, though God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øe his own people with a rod, yet it is in mea≈øure, but the bones of the wicked ≈øhall be broken, it ≈øhall fall very heavy upon them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Though God doth vi≈øit the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his people with a rod, yet it is in ≈øea≈øon, it is but what is very ≈øea≈øonable, they are ≈øo cut and lopt, as that they may grow again, Proverb. 13.24. <hi>He that ≈øpareth the rod, hateth his ≈øon, but he that loveth him cha≈øtneth him betimes,</hi> or in the morning, that is, he doth it in ≈øea≈øon; but now the wicked are ≈øo cut off, that they never grow more;</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Though God vi≈øiteth the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his people with a rod, yet his loving kindne≈øs he will never take away from them: <hi>If they ≈øin, ≈øaith God, I will vi≈øit them with a rod, but my loving kindne≈øs I will not take away from them,</hi> P≈øalm 89.33. But it is not ≈øo with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Though God doth vi≈øit the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his people with a rod, yet he will not ≈øuffer the rod to re≈øt upon their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57690:73"/>backs: if your Garments be dirty or du≈øty, you take a Rod or a wand, and beat out the du≈øt, but when it is out, you do not let the rod re≈øt upon the garment; ≈øo God cau≈øeth his rod to pa≈øs upon his people, but when their dirt and filt is out and removed, he will take away the rod from off them, and will not ≈øuffer it to re≈øt upon their backs: So that you ≈øee there is a va≈øt difference between the rod of the wicked and the rod of the Godly in the≈øe particulars; The rod of the wicked is a breaking rod: but the rod of the Godly is a correcting rod; The rod of the Godly is thrown into the fire, the rod of the wicked is not ≈øo; The rod of the godly is ≈øea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the rod of the wicked is not; the rod of the godly is in love, the rod of the wicked not ≈øo: And la≈øtly, God will not let the rod re≈øt upon the back of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but the rod of the wicked ≈øhall never be removed, and that is the ≈øecond propo≈øition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods Rod is a teaching rod, when God ≈ømites his people he deals with them in the way of the rod, and that is a teaching Rod, it brings a me≈ø≈øage with it, For the cleering of this I ≈øhall ≈øhew you,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, what tho≈øe le≈ø≈øons are which the rod teacheth.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:57690:73"/>
            <p>Secondly, How this Rod teacheth.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you ask what le≈ø≈øons this rod teacheth: I an≈øwer in the General; the Rod teacheth the ≈øame Le≈ø≈øon that the word teacheth, the rod teacheth no new Doctrine; but more particularly, the rod hath a le≈ø≈øon for
<q>
                  <l>The Converted, and for</l>
                  <l>The Unconverted,</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you be unconverted, the rod calls upon you to turn to God: If a drunkard be ≈øick, the rod of ≈øickne≈øs ≈øayes, O Drunkard leave off thy Drunkenne≈øs, and turn to the Lord, this Le≈ø≈øon the rod teacheth; and it taught the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Prodigal; when the rod of mi≈øery and poverty was upon the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, why then ≈øaies he, <hi>I will return to my Father, for in my Fathers hou≈øe is bread enough:</hi> Thus the rod teacheth the Unconverted to turn to the Lord; Art thou in thy ≈øins ≈øtill therefore, O poor ≈øinner, and ha≈øt thou gone on a great while in thy ≈øins, and hath God warned thee often by his word to turn to him, and doth he now come upon thee with his rod? why this is all but to teach thee the ≈øame le≈ø≈øon ≈øtill, though in another way,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57690:74"/>and the le≈ø≈øon is, <hi>Hear and your ≈øouls ≈øhall live, but if you will not hear the whipping, the correcting rod you ≈øhall hear,</hi> and feel the breaking, and the de≈øtroying rod; this is the le≈ø≈øon which the rod teacheth the Unconverted,</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you be Converted,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The rod calls upon you to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your ≈øins more and more, Proverbs 20.30. <hi>The bluene≈øs of a wound clean≈øeth away evil, ≈øo do ≈øtripes the inward parts of the belly, I≈øaiah</hi> 27.9. <hi>By this ≈øhall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Jacob be purged; by this,</hi> that is, by affliction, by the rod; if therefore you have neglected any duty, that you have performed heretofore, or ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, the rod now calls upon you to do it now, <hi>Remember your fir≈øt works and repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If you be Converted, the rod calls upon you to prize tho≈øe common mercies which you have not valued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; you have had peace but you have not prized it, now the rod of war ≈øhould teach you to prize it; you have had a quiet habitation, but you have not prized it, now the rod of Tumult calls upon you to prize your quiet habitation, and to be thankful for it; this is another le≈ø≈øon which the rod teacheth.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you be Converted, the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57690:74"/>rod calls upon you to honour your own graces, Rom. 5.3. <hi>Knowing that tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worketh patience, patience experience, experience hope, and hope maketh not a≈øhamed.</hi> You know how it is with a Countryman, that makes hay, the hay lies abroad, and he ≈øees a black cloud a coming, and he calls to his men to cock up and gather up the Hay; why look into the Nation, and ≈øee what a cloud is over us, this calls upon the people of God to gather up their Evidences: Here is a black cloud over us, O all ye people of God, gather up your evidences, that by the dark night of affliction, you may have light to read your own Graces; this is another le≈ø≈øon the rod teacheth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you be Converted, the rod calls upon you to ≈øympathize with others in their Afflictions; by your own Afflictions you are called upon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øionate others in their Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, and La≈øtly, If you be converted, the rod calls upon you to provide for your great and la≈øt change: <hi>David</hi> under≈øtood this, and therefore he ≈øayes, <hi>Lord teach me ≈øo to number my dayes, that I may apply my heart to true wi≈ødom,</hi> P≈øalm. 90.12.</p>
            <p>The≈øe are the le≈ø≈øons, which the rod teacheth.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:57690:75"/>
            <p>Secondly, If you would know further what the Rod teacheth; I an≈øwer Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Rod doth not teach you any ≈økill or knowledge of its own, but the ≈øpirit of the Lord in the Rod that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man that thou cha≈øtne≈øt, and teache≈øt him out of thy law,</hi> P≈øalm 94.12. By the Rod a man ≈øhall ≈øee that pre≈øented to him, which lay hid before; when the gla≈øs is ≈øhaken you ≈øee that ≈øand, which you could hardly, or not at all perceive before; ≈øo when a man is ≈øhaken by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, his ≈øins are di≈øcovered to him; and a ≈øight of ≈øin is the fir≈øt ≈øtep to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the Rod you are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and broken, and made more fit and capable to receive in≈øtruction; when the young Hor≈øe is once well broke, then he is afterwards fit for the ≈øaddle; now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions break men, and fit them for Gods ≈øervice, and for Gods work: If a narrow mouthed ve≈ø≈øel be in continual motion and unfixed, you cannot pour any liquor into it, you mu≈øt fir≈øt fix the ve≈ø≈øel, and then you may put what you will into it; ≈øo afflictions will fix you, and ≈øettle you, you have many a poor man, that no ground will hold him (as we u≈øe to ≈øay)
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57690:75"/>till afflictions come, and then they ≈øettle him: If you ≈øow ≈øeed, you mu≈øt fir≈øt plow the ground, and then you ≈øow the ≈øeed; now what ≈øoul is there which doth not need Gods plow; why Gods Rod is his plow, and when this Rod comes and breaks, and humbles the heart, then it will receive the good ≈øeed of Gods word into the furrows of the heart; And further,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the Rod a man will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lay hold of, and ≈øtick to tho≈øe promi≈øes, which he could not lay hold on before; for when the Rod comes and brings him low, the man is glad to run to the promi≈øe; and truly it is a very great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us, that we have a promi≈øe to run unto, when we are brought low with the Rod; and thus you ≈øee what le≈ø≈øons the Rod teacheth, and al≈øo how the Rod teacheth, it is a teaching Rod: And ≈øo I have done with the third propo≈øition, the next follows.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As the Rod is teaching, and doth bring a me≈ø≈øage with it; ≈øo this me≈ø≈øage is ≈øent, e≈øpecially to the great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Towns of a Nation, or people, <hi>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City</hi> here in the Text; why, what City or Cities? It was <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> and <hi>Samariah;</hi> but did not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57690:76"/>Gods voice cry unto the le≈ø≈øer Towns and Villages? Yes, but when a national Rod comes, the me≈ø≈øage is e≈øpecially ≈øent to the great Towns, and Cities of a Nation. For,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Rod comes to avenge the Quarrel of the word; look therefore on that place, or people that have had the greate≈øt opportunities, as to hearing of the word, and having the means of grace, and yet have abu≈øed them; the greater controver≈øie hath the Rod with that place or people. Now great Towns, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have commonly the greate≈øt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities as to the word and ordinances, and many times they are mo≈øt abu≈øed in and by the≈øe; and therefore the voice of the Rod is e≈øpecially to great Towns, and Cities: <hi>Wo unto thee Capernaum,</hi> and why unto <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and not to the Towns and Villages? Why, <hi>Woe unto thee</hi> Capurnaum, <hi>for thou ha≈øt been exalted unto Heaven,</hi> in regard of the means, and yet ha≈øt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.23. therefore woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, above all the re≈øt of the Towns about thee: And ≈øo <hi>O</hi> Jeru≈øalem, Jeru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>I cannot but weep over thee; I would have gathered you but you would not,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore I cannot but weep over you; though the le≈ø≈øer Towns
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57690:76"/>and villages ≈øhall be de≈øtroyed, as well as the great ones; yet I weep not over them but over <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> for ≈øhe hath had the means of grace more abundantly, and yet hath not repented; and therefore I cannot but weep over it. When the Rod comes, I ≈øay, it comes more directly to the great Towns and Cities of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God will be ≈øure to puni≈øh tho≈øe that are the Ringleaders of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in a Nation: Now great Cities and Towns if they are not good, are ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to other Towns to do evil: Even as a great Oke, which drops upon the le≈ø≈øer trees under him, ≈øpoils their growth, and corrupts them: And ≈øo if a man be rich, and not good, he drops upon others, and ≈øpoiles others: So I ≈øay, great Towns if not good, ≈øpoyl and corrupt the le≈ø≈øer Towns and Villages; as if they be good, they are an help and an encouragement to others in goodne≈øs; therefore the Lords voice cryeth unto the Cities; and they ≈øhould all hear the rod, and who hath appointed it: that is the fourth propo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The fifth and main followeth, that</p>
            <p>Fifthly, When the Lord doth vi≈øit the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his people with a Rod, it is their true intere≈øt, and be≈øt wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57690:77"/>to hear the Rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it.</p>
            <p>There are three things in this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, When God doth vi≈øit the tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øions of his people with a Rod, it is their duty to hear what the Rod ≈øaith. And</p>
            <p>Secondly, Not only to hear what the rod ≈øaith, but al≈øo to con≈øider who hath appointed it. And</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is their true intere≈øt, and be≈øt wi≈ødom ≈øo to do.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall not much in≈øi≈øt upon the≈øe. But for the fir≈øt,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, When the Lord doth vi≈øit the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions of his people with a Rod, it is their duty to hear what the Rod ≈øaith; for as you hear, Gods Rod is a teaching Rod; and therefore when the Rod comes, it is your duty to lay your car clo≈øe to the rod, to hear what it ≈øays; for otherwi≈øe you will be found de≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øers of its me≈ø≈øage. If a King ≈øend his Amba≈ø≈øadour to ≈øpeak and treat with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he turns his ear from him, and will not hear him; why, will not he be found a de≈øpi≈øer of the me≈ø≈øage? Now the Rod is a Me≈ø≈øenger, an Amba≈ø≈øadour, and it comes from Heaven; if you will
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57690:77"/>not hear it, you de≈øpi≈øe the me≈ø≈øage of the Rod; not hearing is de≈øpi≈øing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Rod comes, hear the me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of it, <hi>my ≈øon de≈øpi≈øe not the cha≈øtening of the Almighty, ≈øaith</hi> Solomon, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is your duty to hear the Rod, and al≈øo to con≈øider who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it; not only to hear the In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Author al≈øo whereby the Rod is acted and guided: For</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Thereby you will honour God in his di≈øpen≈øations: It was the ≈øpeech of Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> when the Souldiers broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hou≈øe and plundred him, ≈øaith he, <hi>it is the Lord that hath taken them away;</hi> he did not ≈øay this thing they have taken away, and they have taken away ≈øuch, and ≈øuch things; no, he would not give them that honour; but as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaid when the <hi>Sabeans</hi> took away his goods, <hi>the Lord gives, and the Lord takes away;</hi> ≈øo ≈øaid he, <hi>I will not honour them ≈øo much, as to ≈øay that they have taken away any thing from me, but the Lord hath done it;</hi> and thereby he gives God the honour of his di≈øpen≈øati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ≈øo mu≈øt you, if you will hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By hearing the Rod, and who hath appointed it; you will much ≈øtrengthen your faith.</p>
            <pb n="148" facs="tcp:57690:78"/>
            <p>Thirdly, By hearing the Rod, and who hath appointed it, you will be inabled to ≈øubmit ≈øweetly to the ≈øharp anger of Gods di≈øpen≈øations; <hi>I was dumb and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not my mouth, becau≈øe thou did≈øt it,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David,</hi> P≈øalm 39.9. So when <hi>Shimei</hi> cur≈øed <hi>David,</hi> his ≈øervants would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off his head, no ≈øaith <hi>David, Let him alone, it is the Lord that hath bidden him,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.11. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> makes mention of a young man a Martyr, that when he was upon the Cart going to the fire; his Father who was a Papi≈øt, came out of his hou≈øe, and would have beaten him, but the people hindring him; <hi>Pray</hi> ≈øaid he, <hi>let him alone, for he is my Father.</hi> So I ≈øay by hearing the Rod, and who hath appointed it, you will ≈øubmit unto the Lord, becau≈øe he is your Father.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By hearing the Rod, and who hath appointed it, you will be led to prayer, and be brought to pray: Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer becomes a man or woman, when they are under the Rod: Pray tell me, when the child is whipt by his Father, doth the child fall down to the Rod, and beg of the Rod to ≈øpare him; no but he falls down to him, in who≈øe hand the Rod is, to his Ma≈øter, or his Father, and cries to him O ≈øpare me, pray ≈øpare me: So be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57690:78"/>not ≈øtubborn, but fall down to the Lord, when you are under the rod; and ≈øay, Lord ≈øpare me; do not ≈øay to the Rod ≈øpare me, do not cry to that when it is upon your backs; no, but ≈øee God, and ob≈øerve his hand, and cry to him for help. But then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As it is our duty to hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it; ≈øo it is al≈øo our true intere≈øt and be≈øt wi≈ødom to do it, becau≈øe it is the way to prevent further ≈øtrokes; when a child is under the Rod, and will not ≈øubmit; why ≈øays the Ma≈øter, <hi>≈øince you are ≈øo ≈øtout and ≈øo ≈øtubborn, I'le try who ≈øhall be Ma≈øter, you or I;</hi> and ≈øo he ≈øtrikes on ≈øtill, till the child cries out I have done, why then ≈øays the Ma≈øter I have done too: And thus it is with us, when we are under the Rod, if we be ≈øtubborn, and refu≈øe to hear the Rod of God, and who hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; well ≈øays God, <hi>I will try who ≈øhall be Ma≈øter, you or I:</hi> what is the rea≈øon that ≈øome men go ≈øo long, ≈øo many years with the rod upon their backs; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they have not heard the Rod, and who hath appointed it; but now when a man ≈øhall ≈øay, <hi>Lord I have done,</hi> why then ≈øays God, <hi>I have done too, O ≈øoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57690:79"/>
            <p>Beloved it is our be≈øt wi≈ødom, and our be≈øt cour≈øe, to hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>All that I ≈øhall ≈øay for Application, is this; It is our true intere≈øt, and be≈øt wi≈ødom, when the Rod comes, to hear the rod, and who hath appointed it, as hath been proved.</p>
            <p>O then that men were wi≈øe, and did under≈øtand it in this day. O England, England, the Rod is in thy ≈øtreets at this time, certainly there is a ≈øwinging Rod hangs over this Nation: O England what ≈øhall I ≈øay unto thee, but what the Prophet ≈øaith here; <hi>Hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it:</hi> O <hi>London</hi> Hear thou the Rod, and who hath appointed it, O <hi>Norwich</hi> Hear thou the Rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, O <hi>Yarmouth</hi> hear thou the Rod, and who hath appointed it, for you ≈øhall thereby honour God, and ≈øtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then your own faith, you ≈øhall be able to keep ≈øilence in the evil day; you ≈øhall be made more fit to pray, and the rod will be ≈øooner removed from you. Therefore as you de≈øire that God may have the honour of all his di≈øpen≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that your faith may be ≈øtrengthened, and that you may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to be ≈øilent in an evil day; then
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57690:79"/>hear the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, what ≈øhall we do that we may hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it; we do confe≈øs that there is a ≈ømart Rod upon the back of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and upon the back of our families, but what ≈øhall we do that we may hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>I An≈øwer, Fir≈øt, Stand, and look upon the Rod, and you will find two things e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the Rod;
<list>
                  <item>1. Your Sin, and</item>
                  <item>2. Gods De≈øign.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>As for your ≈øin, look what ≈øin that is, which God holds before your face, before your con≈øcience, all the time he is ≈øtriking of you with the Rod, that is the ≈øin he ≈øtrikes you for. If a Dog worry a ≈øheep, you commonly go and beat the Dog in the face of the worried Sheep, that the Dog may thereby know and under≈øtand for what he is beaten: So when the Lord comes, and holds out one ≈øin for you to look on, e≈øpecially, then you may be ≈øure, the Rod comes upon you for that ≈øin.</p>
            <p>Again, Look what ≈øin that is, which doth naturally bring the Rod, that is the cau≈øe of it: As for example, If a man be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57690:80"/>drunk, and do thereby bring him≈øelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a feavor, will you not ≈øay that drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne≈øs was the cau≈øe of it?</p>
            <p>Again, Look what ≈øin that is, which is mo≈øt like the Rod of all others, that ≈øin is that which brings the Rod; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Suppo≈øe the Rod of this Nation be decay of Trading; may we not think, that ≈øome <hi>Stoln wedg of Gold</hi> is in this Nation, which is the cau≈øe of this Rod, becau≈øe it is like it: Or ≈øuppo≈øe the Rod of this Nation be, the Lords for≈øaking of it; may we not think that Apo≈øtacy is the cau≈øe of it, becau≈øe it is like it; therefore if you would hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it, then ob≈øerve what ≈øin that is which is the cau≈øe of it. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, And ≈øo to conclude, as you are to look upon your ≈øin, ≈øo al≈øo upon Gods de≈øign in the Rod: Now God ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never gives any mercy to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but he fir≈øt brings them into the quite contrary condition; as for example, If God intends to give you great a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his love, he will fir≈øt ≈øuffer you to fall into great Temptations, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, that he may thereby fit you for great a≈ø≈øurance: Or if God intend to rai≈øe you to great honour in the world,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57690:80"/>he will fir≈øt ≈øuffer you to lie under ≈øome great reproach, that you may be thereby the more fit for your honour; And ≈øo, if God intend to fix, and ≈øettle a Nation, he will fir≈øt ≈øuffer it, to come into great confu≈øion, and tumult, becau≈øe the Lord will thereby prepare that Nation, for the glorious ≈øettlement which he intends.</p>
            <p>How is it therefore with you? do you feel or ≈øee, the Rod of God upon this Nation, or upon your families, or upon the back of your own particular per≈øon? <hi>then hear ye the Rod, and who hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</hi> For Gods Rod is a teaching Rod, and it brings many le≈ø≈øons with it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I ≈øay to one, I ≈øay to all, and to my own ≈øoul al≈øo, <hi>Hear ye the Rod, and who hath appointed it.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to pronounce ≈øome heavy Judgements again≈øt Gods own people I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, wherein there are three things mo≈øt con≈øiderable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Judgement Threatned.</item>
               <item>2. The cau≈øe of the Judgement, and</item>
               <item>3. The Inference thereupon</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Judgement Threatned, and that is in the ≈øecond, and third ver≈øes; <hi>The Lord hath ≈øworn by his holine≈øs, that to, the dayes ≈øhall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterity with fi≈øh-hooks.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57690:81"/>I will ≈øend Anglers among you, that ≈øhall pull you out of your hou≈øes, as the little fi≈øhes are pulled out of the water; and then he goes on in the third ver≈øe; <hi>And ye ≈øhall go out at the breaches ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> Though you be great and ≈øtrong yet will I make breaches among you ≈øaith the Lord, this is the Judgement threatned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the cau≈øe of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that is therefold,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Oppre≈ø≈øion, as at the fir≈øt ver≈øe, <hi>Hear this word ye kine of Ba≈øhan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppre≈øs the poor, which cru≈øh the needy, and ≈øo forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Another cau≈øe is Idolatry, and Super≈øtition; as at the 4. and 5. ver≈øes, <hi>Come ye to Bethel, and tran≈øgre≈øs at Gilgal, multiply tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion; Proclaim and publi≈øh the free offering, for this liketh you, O ye children of I≈ørael ≈øaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third cau≈øe is their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigablene≈øs, as at the 6. ver≈øe, <hi>I have given you cleane≈øs of Teeth in all your Cities, and want of bread in all your places, yet have ye not returned to me ≈øaith the Lord.</hi> And at the 7. ver≈øe, <hi>And al≈øo I have with-holden rain from you, and I have cau≈øed it to rain upon one City, and not upon another City, ≈øo two or three Cities wandred unto one City to drink water, but they were not ≈øatisfied,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57690:82"/>yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> and at the 9. ver≈øe, <hi>I have ≈ømitten you with bla≈øting and with mildew, when your gardens, and your vineyards, and your figtrees, and your olive trees increa≈øed, the palmer worm devoured them, yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> and at the 10. ver≈øe, <hi>I have ≈øent among you the Pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, after the manner of Egypt, your young men have I ≈ølain with the ≈øword, and have taken away your hor≈øes, and I have made the ≈øtink of your camps, to come up unto your no≈øtrils, yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord,</hi> and at the 11. ver≈øe, <hi>I have overthrown ≈øome of you, as God overthrew Sodom, and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand pluckt out of the burning, yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Therefore by way of Inference he concludes;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore this will I do unto thee O I≈ørael, and becau≈øe I will do this unto thee, prepare to neet thy God O I≈ørael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the≈øe words you have a double In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which God makes,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Therefore thus will I do unto thee, I have been a long time ≈øtriving with you (as if he ≈øhould ≈øay) and I have been at a ≈øtand whether I ≈øhould puni≈øh you or not, yet have ye not returned
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57690:82"/>unto me, therefore now I am re≈øolved, <hi>thus will I do unto thee.</hi> And then</p>
            <p>Secondly, Now I am re≈øolved, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet thy God O I≈ørael, therefore do thou prepare to meet thy God O I≈ørael: I do not ≈øend you a challeng ≈øaith God, that you ≈øhould prepare to meet with your God to fight with him, or to re≈øi≈øt him, not to meet God in his anger, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe him, no; but prepare to meet thy God, by preventing his Judgements, with your Repentance, and returning unto him. If a man be coming to your hou≈øe, and you go out to meet him, why then you prevent him by meeting of him; So when we prevent Gods Judgements, by our Repentance, we are ≈øaid to meet with God.</p>
            <p>From hence then I take up this Ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That when God is re≈øolved to come out again≈øt a Nation or people, it is their duty to prepare to meet with God.</p>
            <p>For the opening and pro≈øecuting hereof I ≈øhall labour to ≈øhew you,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That God doth ≈øeem ≈øometimes to be at a ≈øtand concerning a people, whether he ≈øhould tru≈øt to them any longer or not, or whether he ≈øhould puni≈øh them or not.</p>
            <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57690:83"/>
            <p>Secondly, That if they do not come to him, and meet with him, he will then re≈øolve to go out again≈øt them in his wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That when God doth re≈øolve to go out again≈øt a people in his wrath, it is their duty to prepare to meet him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ≈øhall labour to ≈øhew, how a people, or family, or per≈øon, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them≈øelves to meet with God in the way of his anger, when he is going out again≈øt them.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Though God is alwaies re≈øolved in him≈øelf what to do with a people, yet he ≈øeems to us to be at a ≈øtand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ≈øhould deliver them or not, or whether he ≈øhould puni≈øh them or not, whether he ≈øhould ≈øhew mercy to them or not; as you may ≈øee Exod. 33.5. <hi>For the Lord ≈øaid unto</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>≈øay unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>ye are a ≈øtiffnecked people; I will come up into the mid≈øt of thee in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and con≈øume thee; therefore now put off thy Ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee,</hi> that I may ≈øhew, or make known what to do unto thee, as it is in the Hebrew: this is ≈øpeaking after the manner of men; and ≈øo in Gen. 18.21. <hi>I will go down now, and ≈øee whether they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57690:83"/>have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me, and if not, I will know:</hi> And Again, Gen. 22.12. <hi>Lay not thine hand upon the Lad, neither do any thing unto him, for now I know that thou feare≈øt God;</hi> ≈øpeaking after the manner of men. And Again, Ho≈øea 6.4. <hi>O</hi> Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im <hi>what ≈øhall I do unto thee, O</hi> Judah <hi>what ≈øhall I do unto thee;</hi> And in Ho≈øea 11.8. <hi>How ≈øhall I give thee up O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>how ≈øhall I deliver thee</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>how ≈øhall I make thee as</hi> Admah, <hi>how ≈øhall I ≈øet thee as</hi> Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim: Here are four Hows in our Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, though but two in the Hebrew, <hi>How ≈øhall I give thee up, How ≈øhall I deliver thee, How ≈øhall I make thee as</hi> Admah. <hi>How ≈øhall I ≈øet thee as</hi> Zeboim: As if the Lord, (to ≈øpeak after the manner of men) were in a great ≈øtreight, and knew not what to do, was not re≈øolved what to do; So I ≈øay though God is alwaies re≈øolved in him≈øelf, yet he ≈øeems to us to be at a ≈øtand ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, whether he ≈øhall ≈øhew mercy or no.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, how doth this come to pa≈øs, that God doth ≈øometimes ≈øeem to be thus at a ≈øtand.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, you know how it is with a tender Father, that hath a rebellious Child; ≈øaith the Father, I will thru≈øt him
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57690:84"/>out of doors, I will utterly ca≈øt him off, I have often admoni≈øhed him, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and corrected him, and yet he is never the better, therefore I am re≈øolved even to turn him out of doors; I but then he reflects, and thinks again, He is my child, he is the Son of my bowels, how ≈øhall I, how can I give him up, how can I turn him out of doors? why now God is more tender to his Children, than any Father can be to his Children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his being at a ≈øtand doth ≈øpeak out, and declare his bowels to his people: His bowels are at work whil≈øt their ≈øins pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him; One while he looks upon their ≈øins, and another while he looks upon Chri≈øts ≈øatisfaction; one while he hears the Law call Ju≈øtice, Ju≈øtice, another while he hears Chri≈øt cry Mercy, Mercy; There is Ju≈øtice and mercy both in God, that he may have the honour of both, and therefore God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; ≈øaies God, The≈øe are my people, and if I puni≈øh them the enemies will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me, and I ≈øhall be di≈øhonoured, and they are my people ≈øtill for all their ≈øinning again≈øt me, and thus God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, when may God ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand, and not to be re≈øolved
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57690:84"/>what to do, ≈øpeaking after the manner of men.</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer fir≈øt, when the Saints and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters of God, know not what is be≈øt to be done in regard of the times, then is God at a ≈øtand, For ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>≈øhall I do any thing, and not reveal it to my ≈øervants the Prophets:</hi> Therefore I ≈øay when the Saints, and Servants, and Mini≈øters of God are at a ≈øtand, and know not what to do, then God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When the Di≈øpen≈øations of God, go forward, and backward, then the Lord ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand; when a man goes out of his hou≈øe about his bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and goes forward and backward in the ≈øtreet, you will ≈øay, that man is not well re≈øolved what to do, nor which way to go; And thus it ≈øeems to be ≈øometimes with God, his dipen≈øations in the world go forward, and backward, and this is the time, that God is, as it were at a ≈øtand, whether he ≈øhall ≈øhew mercy or no; And ≈øo I have done with the fir≈øt general.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond is this: That though God ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand ≈øometimes, yet if men do not come unto him, and meet him. He will re≈øolve to go forth again≈øt them, <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee:</hi> I have been a long time ≈øtriving with you, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57690:85"/>yet have ye not returned unto me, and now I am re≈øolved, and this is Gods Me≈ø≈øage.</p>
            <p>Now for the cleering of this</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, I ≈øhall open the truth of it unto you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ≈øhall prove it, and</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you, when God may be ≈øaid to go forth again≈øt a people or Nation.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For opening of it, you mu≈øt not think, as I ≈øaid before, that God is at any time unre≈øolved in him≈øelf, or that he knows not what to do, No, <hi>For known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world,</hi> unto the end ≈øaies the Apo≈øtle. Acts 15.18. There is nothing future, or to come, to God; God is not mea≈øured, neither doth he mea≈øure by time; There is nothing before, nor after with God in Eternity; All is pre≈øent, and altogether before him at once, and therefore I ≈øay God is not at any time unre≈øolved in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, what he ≈øhall do with this or that people. Now further, God is ≈øaid to will a thing in a twofold re≈øpect, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<list>
                  <item>Of his Decree, or</item>
                  <item>Of his Di≈øpen≈øations.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>In regard of his decree, his love is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57690:85"/>from Eternity, and yet the ≈øame man may ≈øeem to be a child of wrath in regard of the di≈øpen≈øation: every Elect per≈øon is a child of God from Eternity in regard of Gods decree, and yet he is a child of wrath until he be converted in regard of Gods di≈øpen≈øations. So when I ≈øay, that God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand, and unre≈øolved, and that if men do not come unto him he will then go forth again≈øt them: This is not to be under≈øtood in regard of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, but in regard of his di≈øpen≈øations. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, For the proof of it: it is ≈øaid, God <hi>will not alwayes ≈øtrive with the Children</hi> of men, neither will he alwayes wait, and expect fruit from a fruitles and barren people, Read the parable of the figtree Luke 13.7. <hi>A certain man had a figtree &amp;c. and he ≈øaid unto the dre≈ø≈øer of his <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ineyard, behold the≈øe three years I come, ≈øeeking fruit on this figtree, and find none, cut it down why cumbreth it the ground.</hi> Now though this parable doth concern the Jews, and it concerns us al≈øo, wherein we may ≈øee there are three times, which go over the heads of all tho≈øe that ≈øit under the Go≈øpel.</p>

            <p>There is time of forbearance and ≈øtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a time when God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand, but then if men will not come unto him, he will re≈øolve to go forth again≈øt them. Rom. 2.4, 5. <hi>ver≈øes. De≈øpi≈øe≈øt thou the riches of his goodne≈øs, and forbearance, and long ≈øuffering, not knowing that the goodne≈øs of God leadeth thee to repentance; But after thy hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and impenitent heart, trea≈øure≈øt up unto thy ≈øelf wrath again≈øt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous Judgement of God, who will render to every man according to his deeds.</hi> So I ≈øay that, though God ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand as to his di≈øpen≈øations, yet if men do not come in unto him, he will then re≈øolve to go forth again≈øt them in his wrath.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay further, when may God be ≈øaid to go forth again≈øt a Nation or people in his anger.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For an≈øwer you may know it by Gods di≈øpen≈øations, if his di≈øpen≈øations do be≈øpeak ≈øo much, and do plainly declare that God is going forth again≈øt a Nation or people, then you may be ≈øure that he is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57690:86"/>re≈øolved to go forth in his anger: and therefore</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Ob≈øerve when a Judgement comes that is extraordinary, then the Lord is gone out again≈øt that people: <hi>The Lord is known by the Judgements, which he executeth, the wicked is ≈ønared in the work of his own hands, P≈øal.</hi> 9.16.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Look when God re≈øtrains prayer from a people, when he knocks off, and draws off the hearts of his children from praying for ≈øuch a people, then is God certainly come out again≈øt them in his wrath.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the wor≈øt, then the Lord is again≈øt that people; when all things in≈øtead of working together for the be≈øt, do the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and work together for the wor≈øt, then is God ≈øurely again≈øt that people.</p>
            <p>But then 2. As you may know when God is re≈øolved to go out again≈øt a people by his di≈øpen≈øations, ≈øo you may al≈øo know it by our Practices: As when God afflicts a people for crying Sins, and yet incorrigablene≈øs follows, then doth the Lord re≈øolve to, go again≈øt that people in wrath: As you may ≈øee in this Chapter wherein our Text is, There you find the people were guilty of great ≈øins, of great
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57690:87"/>oppre≈ø≈øion, and great ≈øuper≈øtition, and Idolatry, and God did not only afflict them for the≈øe ≈øins but for others too, and therefore you find in the 7. ver≈øe, <hi>I have with held the rain from you, and have cau≈øed it to rain upon one City, and not upon another,</hi> Here was di≈øtinction of Judgments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ≈øeveral ≈øins: And ≈øo at the 11. ver≈øe. <hi>I have overthrown you, as God overthrew Sodom, and Gomorrah, and you were as firebrands pluckt out of the burning,</hi> &amp;c. God exerci≈øed them with ≈øeveral Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and they were <hi>di≈øtingui≈øhing</hi> affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions too, and yet they were incorriga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; God tells them, that he had afflicted them with cleane≈øs of teeth, and want of rain, <hi>and yet have they not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord, therefore thus will I do unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. Thus you ≈øee what di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing afflictions they were exerci≈øed with, <hi>I have ≈øent the Pe≈øtilence among you, yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord;</hi> and yet after all the≈øe ≈øore ≈øtrokes, they ≈øtill remained incorrigable, and therefore God was re≈øolved to go forth again≈øt them in his wrath, and ≈øo I have done with the ≈øecond General.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is the duty of a people, or Nation to prepare to meet the Lord, when he is coming out again≈øt them:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57690:87"/>
               <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee O I≈ørael, and becau≈øe I will do thus, prepare to meet thy God O I≈ørael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the cleering of this I ≈øhall endeavour to ≈øhew you;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That it is a dreadful thing to meet with God in the way of his anger, and Ju≈øtice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That though it be dreadful, yet it is not ≈øo dreadful to the people of God as to others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That though it be not ≈øo dreadful to the people of God as to others, yet it is very uncomfortable for them too, to meet with God in his wrath.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That when God is gone forth again≈øt a people in his anger, and in the way of his wrath, it is their duty to prepare to meet with God.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is a very dreadful thing to meet with God in the way of his anger, <hi>who may abide the day of his wrath? It is a fearful thing</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>to fall into the hand of the living God,</hi> Heb. 10.31. <hi>For our God is a con≈øumming fire,</hi> Heb. 12.29. not a warming fire: There is a warming fire in your hou≈øes, and that is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in cold weather, but there is a con≈øuming fire al≈øo, a fire that burns down hou≈øes, and Cities, and that fire is very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57690:88"/>terrible and dreadful: why our God is a con≈øuming fire; your fire con≈øumes your wood and coal, but it doth not con≈øume your hou≈øe, it doth not remove the Rocks: but the fire of Gods anger doth ≈øo, as you may ≈øee, Nahum. 1.5, 6. ver≈øes. <hi>The mountains quake at him, the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his pre≈øence, yea the world, and all that dwell therein; who can ≈øtand before his indignation, and who can abide the fiercene≈øs of his anger, his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi> Thus you ≈øee it is a very dreadful thing to meet with God in the way of his anger. But</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though it be dreadful and terrible, yet it is not ≈øo dreadful to the people of God as to others.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Though God be angry with his own people; yet it is but little, in compari≈øon to what he is with others; As in Zach. 1.2. <hi>The Lord was ≈øore di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed with your Fathers,</hi> and at the 12. ver≈øe, <hi>there it is ≈øaid God had indignation again≈øt them three≈øcore and ten years,</hi> and then at the 15. ver≈øe, <hi>And I am very ≈øore di≈øplea≈øed with the Heathen that are at ea≈øe, for I was but a little di≈øplea≈øed, and they helped forward the affliction:</hi> Here you ≈øee God was greatly di≈øplea≈øed with the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57690:88"/>Heathen, and but little di≈øplea≈øed again≈øt his people; his di≈øplea≈øure is but little to them, in compari≈øon with what it is to others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though God be angry with his own people, yet his anger is their friend. If a man be my friend, not only his pur≈øe is my friend, but his ≈øword al≈øo, if I have occa≈øion; ≈øo if God be my friend, not only his love is my friend, but his anger too, but it is not ≈øo with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though God be angry with his own people yet they have alwayes free grace to fly unto, and to be their friend, but it is not thus with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Though God be angry with his own people, yet they know, or may know, that God is in Covenant with them, and that they have ≈øome ≈øweet, and precious promi≈øes which belong to them: Nahum. 1.5, 6. <hi>Who can abide the fiercene≈øs of his wrath,</hi> &amp;c. But look at the 7. ver≈øe. <hi>The Lord is good, a ≈øtrong hold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that tru≈øt in him:</hi> in the wor≈øt times the people of God have promi≈øes to run unto for ≈øhelter; mark how the promi≈øe comes in here: Having ≈øhewed the fiercene≈øs of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57690:89"/>Gods wrath in the 5. and 6. ver≈øes, <hi>who can ≈øtand before his pre≈øence,</hi> &amp;c. He comes in with this promi≈øe at the 7. ver≈øe, The Lord is good, and a ≈øtrong hold in the day of trouble, he knoweth them that tru≈øt in him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Though God be angry with, and afflict his own people, yet they know, or may know, that God is afflicted with them, Chri≈øt partakes in their Afflictions with them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Though God do afflict his own people for their ≈øins, yet they know or may know, that God alwayes gives a due allowance in reference to their ≈øins and Infirmities; the be≈øt Gold mu≈øt have an allowance of ≈øome dro≈øs, and the be≈øt Saint mu≈øt have an allowance upon the Account of his Infirmities, ≈øaies the Lord, Ho≈øea 11.8. <hi>How ≈øhall I make thee as Admah, and ≈øet thee as Zeboim;</hi> why did not the Lord ≈øay; How ≈øhall I make thee as Sodom or Gomorrah, <hi>≈øayes Jerom,</hi> It was becau≈øe Admah, and Zeboim were le≈ø≈øer Cities, and were drawn into ≈øin, by the example of the great Cities of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Gomorrah: and ≈øo the ten Tribes were drawn into ≈øin, by the great Cities of Judah, and by Jeru≈øalem, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ≈øaies, how ≈øhall I make thee as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57690:89"/>Admah, &amp;c. So I ≈øay, God doth alwayes give an allowance to his own people, even in the day of his wrath.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Though God be angry with his own people, yet they may ≈øee God ≈ømile ≈øometimes, even through his frowns; faith doth many times pull the vizard from the face of Chri≈øt as I may ≈øay, that when he ≈øeems to be their enemy, yet ≈øtill they know that all things ≈øhall work together for their good.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Though God be angry with his own people, yet they know, or may know, that God will alwayes have a hiding place for them, and ≈øo he will never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for others. It may be ob≈øerved, that when Gods people in former Times were per≈øecuted in one part of the world, they had alwayes acceptance and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintment in ≈øome other part of the world; and when they were per≈øecuted from thence, they had ≈øtill acceptance el≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, according to that of Chri≈øt, <hi>If they per≈øecute you in one City, flee unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until the Son of Man come, Matt.</hi> 10.23. Why what is the meaning of this, but that God will alwayes have ≈øome hiding place for his people, until Chri≈øt come again.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Though God be angry with
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57690:90"/>his own people, yet they know or may know, that they are delivered from wrath to come, and they may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves thus; Tis true, that this di≈øpen≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God towards me is in anger, but yet I am delivered from wrath to come; but now it is not ≈øo with others, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent di≈øpen≈øations of Gods wrath upon the wicked, are but fore-runners of his eternal wrath, which ≈øhall come upon them; but it is not ≈øo with the Saints. And ≈øo I conclude this ≈øecond particular, That though it be very dreadful when God goes forth again≈øt a people in his wrath, yet it is not ≈øo dreadful to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God as it is to others. But</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Though it be not ≈øo terrible for the people of God to meet with God in his anger and as it is for others, yet it is a very hard and uncomfortable thing for them to meet with God in this way, for they are u≈øed to have other kind of meetings with God, they u≈øe to meet him in the A≈ø≈øemblies, to meet him in love, there the Saints de≈øire to meet with God. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If God do go forth again≈øt a people in his wrath, it is their duty, the duty of them all, and of Gods own people al≈øo, to go forth to meet God: It is here commanded in the Text by way
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57690:90"/>of rea≈øon; It is the duty of Gods people and of others al≈øo, to honour God when they are under his di≈øpen≈øations; now when men go forth to meet God, then they honour him; <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> intended to honour the Angel, and therefore they went forth to meet him; <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> would honour his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and therefore he went forth to meet him: <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> would honour his Father <hi>Jethro,</hi> and therefore he went forth to meet him: <hi>Abigail</hi> would honour <hi>David,</hi> and therefore ≈øhe went forth to meet him; <hi>Martha</hi> would honour <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and therefore went forth to meet him; <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the believing Romans would honour <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore they went forth to meet him: And ≈øo if a man be coming to your hou≈øe, if you would honour him you go forth to meet him; Why now it is our duty to honour God, and therefore it is our duty al≈øo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet with God, that we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by honour him.</p>
            <p>And further It is the duty of all Gods people to hold a compliance with his di≈øpen≈øations, now if you do not go to meet with God, you do not comply with his di≈øpen≈øations: So that I ≈øay when God comes forth again≈øt a people, it is their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57690:91"/>duty to go forth, and to prepare to meet him. And ≈øo I come to the fourth General which was propo≈øed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If it be the duty of a people, when God goes forth again≈øt them in his anger to prepare to meet him, Why then what ≈øhall we do, to prepare our ≈øelves to meet with God; for ≈øometimes God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand, and to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øolved what to do, and ≈øometimes he is re≈øolved to go forth again≈øt a people, now what ≈øhall we do that we may prepare to meet God in both the≈øe Ca≈øes.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall an≈øwer the≈øe two Que≈øtions, and ≈øpeak to them di≈øtinctly, and ≈øo conclude without any further Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you would meet with God in this ca≈øe, then break off from your uncertainties and leave them, do not ≈øtand ≈øhall I, ≈øhall I, as we ≈øay, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to your repentance and newne≈øs of life, be not uncertain in your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and practices. As in Ho≈øea 6.4. <hi>O Ephraim ≈øaith God what ≈øhall I do unto thee, why Lord,</hi> might they ≈øay, <hi>Why art thou at an uncertainty with us, why ≈øaith God, becau≈øe you are at an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57690:91"/>with me, your goodne≈øs is as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away:</hi> Sometimes you take up good re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, but they fade away again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently; Sometimes you are grieved and troubled for ≈øin, but your repentance fades way, as the morning dew; ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you will perform duties, but your goodne≈øs fades away quickly, and therefore I am at this uncertainty with you, becau≈øe you are at ≈øuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty with me; would you then meet with God in this ca≈øe, why then break off from your uncertainties, that is the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If God ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand, then do you repent and turn to God, for this is that which God expects, and looks for, <hi>yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord:</hi> The Lord repeats it again and again, in the clo≈øe of ≈øeveral ver≈øes, though I have been at a ≈øtand, yet have ye not returned unto me ≈øaith the Lord. Therefore I ≈øay when God ≈øeems to be at a ≈øtand, be ≈øure that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto God; and what I ≈øay unto one, I ≈øay unto all, and to my own ≈øoul al≈øo; Doth the Lord ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand with us, then let us all return to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57690:92"/>the Lord by repentance, it may be he ≈øtaies his hand to ≈øee what we will do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If God ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand, and if you would meet with him, then go, and make your choice, <hi>Chu≈øe rather to ≈øuffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the plea≈øures of ≈øin for a ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Lord ≈øeem to be at an uncertainty in point of his di≈øpen≈øations, and if you would meet with God, then take heed that you do not de≈øire the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day, take heed that there be none among you who do de≈øire the wofull day to come: A day of confu≈øion in a Nation is a wofull day, a day of civil War is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full day, civil War begins with uncivil ≈øins, and ends in uncivil Butcheries. Again</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If God ≈øeem to be at a ≈øtand, in point of his di≈øpen≈øations, and if Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations do then come to draw you off from God, why do you an≈øwer all with this: How ≈øhall I do this thing, and yet not ≈øin again≈øt God, how ≈øhall I do this thing, and yet not ≈øin again≈øt my own con≈øcience, ≈øhall the Lord have his <hi>How's</hi> for you as I may ≈øay, and will you
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57690:92"/>have none for him? ≈øhall the Lord ≈øay, How ≈øhall I give thee up, <hi>O England!</hi> How ≈øhall I give thee up; <hi>O London!</hi> How ≈øhall I give thee up, <hi>O Yarmouth!</hi> and will not you ≈øay, How ≈øhall I ≈øin again≈øt the Lord, ≈øhall the Lords bowels yearn, and turn within him for you, and ≈øhall not you turn to God; ≈øhall the Lord ≈øay, O Drunkard! How ≈øhall I give thee up? O Swearer! How ≈øhall I give thee up? O Sabbath-breaker! how ≈øhall I give thee up? O unclean Per≈øon or the like, how ≈øhall I give thee up? And ≈øhall not you ≈øay how ≈øhall I do this thing, and yet not ≈øin again≈øt God? Therefore do thus, and then you will be able to meet with God in this ca≈øe.</p>
            <p>But 2. As for the ≈øecond part of this Que≈øtion. Suppo≈øe the Lord be re≈øolved as I hope he is not, to go forth again≈øt this Nation, you may ob≈øerve how he ≈øtands hovering as it were over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if God ≈øhould re≈øolve to go out again≈øt us, would you know how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet with God?</p>
            <p>Then you mu≈øt ob≈øerve what tho≈øe evils are that do provoke God, and labour and ≈øtrive again≈øt them till they be removed; and in order hereunto,</p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:57690:93"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you would meet with God in the way of his Ju≈øtice and Anger, then you mu≈øt get Chri≈øt into your Arms, as I may ≈øay, and ≈øo go forth and meet God: It is written of one, that when he would gain favour of his King, he u≈øe to get the Kings ≈øon in his Arms, and ≈øo he got the favour he de≈øired; ≈øo if you would find favour with God, get Je≈øus Chri≈øt into your arms, and ≈øo go forth to meet him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you would meet with God in the way of his anger and Ju≈øtice, then you mu≈øt humble your ≈øelf before him and ≈øubmit unto him: There are two parts in Humiliation, Sorrow for ≈øin, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to God; now it may be you are wanting in one of the≈øe, therefore labour to abound in both, and ≈øo go forth to meet God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would meet with God in the way of his anger and Ju≈øtice, then do you live ju≈øtly, and deal ju≈øtly and righteou≈øly. <hi>He hath ≈øhewed thee O man what is good, and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do ju≈øtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God;</hi> Micah. 6.8. O my friends, labour to do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and what God expects: Now when he comes out again≈øt a people in the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57690:93"/>way of his Ju≈øtice, he expects that they ≈øhould be found doing Ju≈øtice; read the 9. ver≈øe, <hi>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City, Hear ye the rod, and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it;</hi> Gods voice is to ≈øcare us, and to cau≈øe us to leave ≈øin and to turn unto him, and therefore he ≈øayes, Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you would meet with God in the way of his anger, then pre≈øent unto God your free-will offerings, and pray unto him and ≈øeek his face; when <hi>Jacob</hi> went forth to meet his brother <hi>E≈øau,</hi> he ≈øent pre≈øents to him, and his brothers face was changed; O what will become of tho≈øe that never prayed one prayer more in private for all this anger and wrath of God, that ≈øeems to be coming out again≈øt us.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would meet with God in his anger, then get ≈øuffering grace: How can you be able to meet with God in the way of his anger in ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Times, if you have not ≈øuffering grace?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would meet with God in his anger, be ≈øure to be doing the work of your pre≈øent day; ≈øhew mercy
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57690:94"/>to tho≈øe that want mercy, They that are merciful ≈øhall obtain mercy with God; what will your money avail you in the day of Gods wrath? The only way to meet with God in his wrath, is to ≈øhew mercy.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If you would be able to meet with God in the way of his anger, then wait upon God in the way of his Judgements, and in due time you ≈øhall be able to ≈øay, This is our God, <hi>Loe this our God we have waited for him;</hi> and if God be going, lay hold of him, take hold upon him, for ≈øo we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Haiah 27.4, 5. <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Or let him take hold of my ≈øtrength that he may make peace with me, and he ≈øhall make peace with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, If you would meet with God in the way of his anger, then lay a≈øide your particular Intere≈øts, and think it your duty, and de≈øire to do it.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, If you would prepare to meet with God in the way of his anger, then now whil≈øt you have a little time, Goe and ≈øet your ≈øelf and your hou≈øe in order, that what≈øoever may come, you may have nothing
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57690:94"/>el≈øe to do but to dye; And then if God do come in Judgement, and Anger, you may be able to ≈øay I have heard the Rod, and have trembled, and have prepared to meet with God: And if God ≈øhould not come in wrath, but ≈øome other way, yet you will have great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in your preparing to meet with God; For either God will come out again≈øt the Nation in anger, or he will not; if he do not, you will not lo≈øe by your preparing to meet him; but if he do, and you are prepared to meet with him, then will God meet with you in Love, becau≈øe you have prepared to meet with him in Anger.</p>
            <p>Therefore as you de≈øire to be found doing the work, that God would have you to do in this Ca≈øe, Think of, and remember what hath been ≈øpoken. All you that hear this word of God, prepare to meet with God, you know not how ≈øoon the Lord may come out again≈øt you in wrath, his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øations in the world ≈øeem to run backward, and forward: Therefore
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57690:95"/>be alwayes ready, and prepared to meet with God, which way ≈øoever he may come, according to this of our Text,</p>
